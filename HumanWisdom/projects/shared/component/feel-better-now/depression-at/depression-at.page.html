                      A toolkit to deal with depression
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      10% of the world population suffers from depression so you are not alone. 1 in 4 women will suffer depressive symptoms in their lifetime. Many times we are not aware we are depressed - just like we may not be aware we are stressed.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      It's a medical condition and can affect anyone - just like diabetes or a heart attack.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      If you feel persistently sad, are not sleeping well, have lost the normal enjoyment you got from things you did, have thoughts of self-harm and your appetite is affected you may have depression. Each of these can be caused by other factors, but put together they are signs of depression. The module on depression that follows has the details.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Depression can vary in severity from mild feelings of being sad, to severe depression where we withdraw from others and it can feel like a really dark place.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      There are things you can do to feel better now, including journaling, breathing exercises, meditation or tapping, but that will not last long unless you go deeper and uncover the root causes of it and learn to shift your mindset in relation to what has happened.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      The module on depression that follows is detailed and created with several psychologists. It helps you diagnose the problem, and then go on a step by step journey to recovery, by setting small goals, and by changing how you think about what has happened in your life to make you feel this way.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      It is possible to find joy in your life again, but you have to want to be better and  be willing to make an effort. Lets get started.
