                      Manage your own anger
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      About 1 in 10 people have an anger management problem that significantly impacts their lives and 1 in 4 say they worry about how angry they get. If you struggle to manage your anger you are not alone.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Anger is important to protect us from physical harm and an essential part of being human - but when it is uncontrolled it can harm us and others, damage our relationships and lead to long term unhappiness.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      We seem to have no control over our anger sometimes and it can just erupt - sometimes catching us by surprise.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      When we are angry the app offers things you can do to calm down now - breathing exercises, a meditation, journaling, or a tapping exercise.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Once you feel more calm, would you like to explore how you can better manage your anger next week, next month and for the future? If not, it will keep on erupting and spoiling your own life.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      We assume our anger is triggered by others, or our circumstances -  that's just how our mind is wired - but it is not always the case.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      The most important thing to realise is that anger is an automatic reaction from our thinking to an external trigger - and behind all anger is a feeling of being disappointed or hurt. If we want to manage our own anger better, because it's harming our mental and physical health and our relationships, we need to begin by taking ownership of it and being curious about what lies behind it, without blaming ourselves or others for it.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      As we go on this journey of learning about our own mind and why we get angry, we can learn to manage our anger better so it serves itâ€™s rightful purpose in our life.
                    </p>
