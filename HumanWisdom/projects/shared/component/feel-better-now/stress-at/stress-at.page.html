                      80% of people feel stressed - so you are not alone. It impacts our physical and mental health so it's worth putting some effort into finding a solution for it. You have taken the first step and are here - so thats great.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      There are many features in the app to help you deal with stress when it arises - breathing exercises, meditations, journaling or some tapping exercises.

                      Would you like to be free of stress tomorrow, next week and for the long term? Would you like to manage your challenges better without getting stressed? This will have a positive impact on your physical and mental health. For this next phase, as we look for long term solutions, there is no quick fix and you will have to do the work yourself. We are here to guide you in a gentle step by step way to do so.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Our mind assumes stress is inevitable and caused by external circumstances - but that is not the case. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      You see, stress is an automatic reaction from our thinking to external events - and to be free of stress we can either change the event - and we do that if it is possible - or we can change how we react to it. For example if we are stuck in a traffic jam we assume it is the traffic jam that is causing our stress, but if we look carefully we see that it is our reaction to the traffic jam that is really behind our stress. To get over our stress we can either change the traffic jam - which we cannot - or change our reaction to it.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      To change how we react we need to understand our own mind, where the reaction begins, and why we react in the way that we do. The more we understand our own mind the more we can be in charge of it and respond to our challenges with an inner intelligence.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      This does not mean the challenges do not not have to be dealt with - but we can do so with a mind that is calm and so much more capable.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      There are also many causes of stress which originate in our own thinking, but we are usually not aware of them. For example our mind is always comparing itself with others without our awareness and this can cause so much heartache. Once we see that clearly we can stop that and only compare when it serves us. So much of our can can be prevented once we do that.
                    </p>
