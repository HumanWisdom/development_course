                      Long term solutions to anxiety
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      In some surveys 60% of people suffer from anxiety - so you are not alone.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      When we are anxious it is like being in a fog without a clear way forward and our mind can be paralyzed by fear. In this situation we need to calm our mind down with a breathing exercise, a meditation, some journaling, or by doing some tapping. All of them can help.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Once we feel more calm we usually do nothing more, and the same or different  trigger will create the same feeling of anxiety again - it can come on suddenly catching us unawares.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Would you like to explore how you can avoid anxiety in the future and be much less anxious for the long term? It is definitely possible, but will need you to do the work. We will guide you and walk with you as you do so.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      You will need to be open to learning about your own mind and how it functions, and do it without judging yourself and good or bad, right or wrong.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Anxiety is our mind's attempt to control the future - which is often not possible - when you are sitting an exam or going for a job interview.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      The key thing to understand is that our anxiety is a product of our thinking - this is not easy - but when you are anxious, if you distract yourself, your anxiety eases for a while suggesting its linked to our thinking. Or, its not there in deep sleep, but there when we wake up and start thinking.   It follows that the more we understand our own mind and why we think and feel the way we do, the more we can be in charge of our emotional reactions.
                    </p>

                    <p>
