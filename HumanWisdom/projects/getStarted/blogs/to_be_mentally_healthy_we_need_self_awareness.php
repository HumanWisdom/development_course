                    The statistics on mental illness
                  </span>
                  should be a wake-up call for us all. 80% of people say they are moderately to severely stressed and 20-40% say they suffer from anxiety. Addiction is a mental illness and approximately 15% of people are addicted to alcohol, drugs, or gambling. 100,000 people died of a drug overdose in the US alone in 2021. Obesity, which affects 42% of Americans, also originates in our thinking, and is often linked to ‘stress eating’. 5-10% of adults in the world suffer from depression.

                  Mental distress translates into physical illness by impacting our immune system, and shortens our life-span, so it is important we try and find an answer.

                    To be mentally healthy we need emotional intelligence,
                  </span>
                  which comes from a deeper understanding of ourselves and how our mind works.

                <h4 class="mtb0px blog_desc">
                  Our mind is wired to assume that
                  <span class="blog_highlight_black">
                    how we feel is caused by what is happening in the world around us
                  </span>
                  – events make us stressed, people make us unhappy, an uncertain future makes us anxious, the loss of things we loved creates sorrow, being criticised makes us angry, and so on. Our unfulfilled expectations and desires can make us frustrated, angry, and bitter.

                <h4 class="mtb0px blog_desc">
                  If we look more carefully we realise that
                  <span class="blog_highlight_black">
                    our mind is reactive and our suffering is caused by the way our mind automatically reacts to what is happening around us,
                  </span>
                  though this is difficult to understand. This reaction comes from our memory bank – the store of everything that has happened to us so far. We are usually not aware of this process.

                    If I am going to sit an exam
                  </span>
                  I am stressed and anxious and naturally assume the exam is causing my stress. It is not the exam, but perhaps the fear of failure, and the consequences of that for my ego, my future, and how others will see me that creates my anxiety. If I see that clearly I can ask a simple question: What is going on in my thinking to make me feel this way? I can then begin a journey of understanding the nature of fear, my fear of failure and seeing how this is making me feel anxious and stressed. I could ask how realistic is the possibility of failure, or what I would do if I failed.

                    I see if I can accept the possibility of failure, my anxiety goes away.

                  Consider that I am married and
                  <span class="blog_highlight_black">
                    my wife is going out for the evening with her friends.
                  </span>
                  She says she has not had time to cook a meal for the evening and asks me to manage. She normally does all the cooking in the house. I get angry with her for not caring, and blame her for my anger. She gets upset with me, cancels her going out, and the situation escalates. We both end up feeling stressed. I get angry with her over something else the week after, and this pattern continues throughout our marriage. Eventually she gets fed up and decides to leave me. I sink into a depression. I realise my uncontrolled anger destroyed my marriage, but each time I got angry I was so sure I was right, and she was wrong. I now realise that my anger was caused by my own unmet expectations, and my urge to control her behaviour. This is what I had seen when I was growing up and it had become part of my conditioning.
                  <span class="blog_highlight_black">
                    By taking ownership of my anger, and understanding its roots in my thinking, it ceases to be a problem and I no longer get angry when things are not going my way.
