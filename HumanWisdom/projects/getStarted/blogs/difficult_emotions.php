                  Our mind is an automatic reaction machine and often the same triggers evoke the same powerful feelings in us, which repeat in predictable patterns. We seem powerless to do anything about them. These feelings like anxiety, stress, anger, loneliness, and envy can be overwhelming. These emotions can make us do things we may regret like lashing out and hurting others when we are angry. Or drink too much alcohol or binge eat if we are sad. Or get into unsuitable relationships if we are feeling lonely. Or self-harm if the stress is overwhelming and we can’t think of a way out. They stop us from thinking clearly, reduce our ability to concentrate at work, and impact our performance, so it is worth investing our time and energy to explore better ways of dealing with them.

                <h4 class="mtb0px blog_desc">
                  The first step is to find ways of calming the mind. These feelings are often powerful and you lose your ability to control them, or reason and think your way out of them. Lean into the sensation of the feeling in your body without naming it and 
                  <span class="blog_highlight_black">
                    do a breathing exercise, or go for a walk in nature, or listen to an audio meditation or do a tapping exercise. 
                  </span>
                  They activate the parasympathetic nervous system, slowing our breathing down and reducing the stress response. It is important that you have practiced these beforehand so when the challenge arises you are ready.

                  It's a quick way of calming the mind. There is a module called Look without language in the app which can guide you on how to do this.

                  There may be dozens of thoughts swirling in our mind in response to what has happened, for example anxiety around sitting for an exam, or if we are criticized, or if we lose someone we love. How can we make sense of all these thoughts and feelings? Many of our emotions don’t have a name either — and can be a mix of different feelings.

                  </span>
                  and the reaction we have had, accepting it has come from our own mind and not blaming anyone for it. Our mind automatically wants to blame someone for causing this feeling in us — we blame someone else, or the situation. We could also be critical of ourselves for how we feel and not being able to control that feeling. If we are going to explore this feeling further and find out what’s behind it, we need to suspend judgement and accept that though the trigger may have come from the outside, the reaction has been in our own mind, and it is the reaction that has caused our distress. These feelings are not unique to any of us and are part of being human. Acceptance is made easier by realizing that every human being experiences the same range of feelings though the external triggers can be different for each person. Taking ownership does not mean that the external trigger does not need to be addressed, but we can do it with a mind that is calmer.

                  This is where it gets really interesting and you are going to make some amazing discoveries about your own mind. You will be thrilled by them because understanding WHY you feel the way you do helps you make sense of what you feel and that will feel amazing. It's like walking into a room and putting the light on, except the light will be in your own mind.

                  Here are some examples of the discoveries you could make:
                </h4>

                <h4 class="mtb0px blog_desc">
                  1. Behind all our anger is a feeling of hurt or disappointment from an expectation that was not met. These expectations come from our own past influences and our own emotional needs. They are not wrong, but cause us to suffer when they are not met.
                </h4>

                <h4 class="mtb0px blog_desc">
                  2. When we feel envious and blame others for making us feel that way, our hurt actually comes from our mind comparing itself with others all the time and we are not aware of this. It’s also behind our feeling of low self-esteem.
                </h4>

                <h4 class="mtb0px blog_desc">
                  3. Stress is just the difference between how things are and how we want them to be. Accepting things as they are can dissolve our stress. The app offers 14 ways you can be less stressed.
                </h4>

                <h4 class="mtb0px blog_desc">
                  4. We often look for approval from others without realizing it, and need this approval to feel good about ourselves. If we don’t get this approval we feel bad and this can lead to low self-esteem. Seeing this clearly can empower us to not depend on others’ approval, and love ourselves as we are.
                </h4>

                <h4 class="mtb0px blog_desc">
                  Each topic you explore in the app helps you understand what is going on in your own mind. It is only true if you see it clearly for yourself. It’s in actually doing the work of noticing, questioning and understanding for yourself that change occurs. Imagine being free of stress, or anxiety or having relationships without conflict?

                  You can repeat steps 1–5 every time you have an emotion you find difficulty coping with or if you are just curious to learn about yourself. Each time you do so you will notice some improvement.

                  Our emotional reactions are a doorway to learn more about our own mind, and this learning brings transformation and freedom.

                  Step 6 — Realization/ Insight
                </h4>

                <h4 class="mtb0px blog_desc">
                  In the beginning our understanding can be intellectual and the patterns can keep repeating themselves, but we slowly gain control over our emotions. Though we may feel distressed we may not feel as bad as we once did. We may recover more quickly, or not blame others for how we feel, and not make bad decisions.
                </h4>

                <h4 class="mtb0px blog_desc">
                  There will come a point though, and it will come unexpectedly, like a shaft of light breaking through the clouds, when 
                  <span class="blog_highlight_black">
                    you will have a flash of insight or a realization, see something in yourself really clearly, and you will be changed for the long term. It will be like walking into a room and putting the light on.
                  </span>
                </h4>

                <h4 class="mtb0px blog_desc">
                  For example, seeing really clearly that the unconscious process of comparing yourself with others is causing you so much suffering helps you to stop it, and use it only when it serves you. Or seeing clearly that anxiety is your mind’s attempt to control the future, which it cannot do beyond a point, helps to dissolve it.
                </h4>

                <h4 class="mtb0px blog_desc">
                  <span class="blog_highlight_black">
                    Nobody can give you this insight, 
                  </span>
                  you have to discover it for yourself through your own journey of looking and learning about yourself. It’s not an intellectual business — and anyone who wants to can do this — just like anyone who wants to swim can learn to do so. More than anything else you strive for, investing time and energy in this process of learning about yourself and growing as a person will help you make the most of your life.

                <h4 class="mtb0px blog_desc">
                  1. Don’t be disappointed if change does not occur right away. Rome wasn’t built in a day. Be patient with yourself. The key is to get started and keep going. Reach out and ask a question on the forum if you feel stuck.
                </h4>

                <h4 class="mtb0px blog_desc">
                  2. Though it’s described as a 6-step process — that is only to make all the different parts of it really clear. You can do any step in any order, and you have to find out what works best for you. Insight can occur at any time.
                </h4>

                <h4 class="mtb0px blog_desc">
                  3. It is in understanding and seeing clearly what is going on in your own mind that the transformation occurs. Have you seen how difficult it is to ‘Not be envious’, or ‘Get over your own stress’?
                </h4>

                <h4 class="mtb0px blog_desc">
                  4. Be kind to yourself. Accept your feelings as part of being human, and an opportunity to learn about your own mind and grow as a person. They are not right or wrong, good or bad — they just need to be understood.
                </h4>

                <h4 class="mtb0px blog_desc">
                  5. The journey itself is rewarding. Learning never ends. It is going to enrich your life in many ways, and help you live your best life.
