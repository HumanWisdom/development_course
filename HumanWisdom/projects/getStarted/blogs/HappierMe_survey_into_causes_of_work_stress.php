                70-80% of workers report work related stress in most studies but the causes 
                of it have not been studied in depth. According to a recent survey conducted by
                <a class="blog_highlight_peach td_underline" href="https://happierme.app/adults/conditioning">HappierMe</a>
                here a self awareness platform for a happier and more successful life, the main reason for work stress among employees is too much work. The survey asked 1,000 workers from various industries and sectors to rank four possible causes of work stress: too much work, not enough recognition, conflict in relationships and our attitude to work. The results showed that 37% of the respondents chose too much work as the main reason, followed by 23% who selected not enough recognition, 21% who cited conflict in relationships and 18% who attributed work stress to our attitude to work.                </h4>

                <h4 class="mtb0px blog_desc">
                These factors can create a sense of frustration, dissatisfaction and anxiety that can impact our physical and mental health. However, work stress is not inevitable. Here are some strategies that can help us manage and reduce it:                </h4>

                  Too much work:  
                  </span>
                  37% of people said that they felt stressed because they have too much work to do and not enough time to do it. This can lead to burnout, fatigue and reduced productivity. To cope with this, it is important to prioritise your tasks, set realistic deadlines, delegate when possible and take regular breaks. You can also use tools to organise your work and track your progress. It is important for employers to be mindful of how much they expect of their employees, and not overwhelm them.

                  Not enough recognition: 
                  </span>
                  23% of people said that they felt stressed because they do not receive enough recognition or appreciation for their work. This can lead to low self-esteem, resentment and lack of motivation. There are two ways to deal with this. Firstly, to realise that expecting recognition is normal, but gives others the key to our happiness. Can we find a way to value ourselves, and let go of this need for external validation which causes so much of our stress? The second way is for employers to step up and recognise staff for their achievements.

                  Conflict in relationships:

                  21% of people said that they felt stressed because they have conflict or tension with their co-workers, managers or clients. This can lead to anger, distrust and impact collaboration. To deal with this, it is important to resolve conflicts constructively, listen actively, empathise with others and respect different opinions. Accepting other perspectives as being equally valid is so important. The more we understand ourselves, the easier it is to understand others.                </h4>

                  Our attitude to work:
                  </span>
                  18% of people said that they felt stressed because of a negative attitude towards their work. This can lead to dissatisfaction, boredom and cynicism. We need to shift our mindset to being more positive. Our mind usually takes what we already have for granted and focuses on what we don't have. With a positive attitude we can see the best in people and situations and this can make us happier and more productive. We need to bring our happiness to work rather than expecting work to make us happy. 

                <h4 class="mtb0px blog_desc">
                63% of our stress comes from factors not related to our workload. By understanding our own mind we can learn how to manage these ourselves, and this can contribute to us being much less stressed.
