                  based on learning, that could help people manage their own mental health, have happier relationships and improve productivity at the same time.

                <h4 class="mtb0px blog_desc">
                  In a recent survey, the US Surgeon General estimated that 76% of employees had at least one symptom of a mental health problem. 81% said they would be looking for workplaces that support mental health in the future. In a separate survey a 2022 Gallup poll found that only 21% of employees were ‘engaged’ at work, 44% reported high levels of stress, and that this was costing the global economy $7.8 trillion/year. They also found companies with high levels of engagement were 22% more productive. They defined engagement as employees who were keen to go to work. Your organization is probably no exception. The relationship between well-being, engagement, and productivity is clear.

                  <span class="blog_highlight_black">
                    The first step is to realise the importance of wellbeing,
                  </span>
                  and not regard it as an employee perk and a tick-box exercise. If the CEO participates in the program and signals its importance, the rest of the organization will take it seriously as well.

                  People bring their problems from home to work, and vice versa, so we need to address the entire person and support them in all areas of their life. We need to support people to deal with stress (80%), anxiety (20-40%), depression (8.4% in the US), relationship conflict (50%), addiction (10-20%), obesity (42% in the US), low self-esteem, bereavement and so on.

                <h4 class="mtb0px blog_desc">
                  If someone is unhappy they are more likely to be disgruntled, focus on the negative, collaborate less, complain more, and be less engaged because they are preoccupied with their own emotional distress.

                    Preventing a fire is so much easier
                  </span>
                  (and cheaper) than dealing with the consequences. Similarly, preventing all these problems through proactive intervention is better than reacting after the event.
                </h4>

                <h4 class="mtb0px blog_desc">
                  Though all these problems seem disparate they have one common root – 
                  <span class="blog_highlight_black">
                    most are an automatic reaction from our thinking to external events.
                  </span>
                  To get rid of stress for example we can either change the event (which is often not possible), or change our reaction to it. To change our reaction, we need to take ownership of our thoughts and feelings, and be curious as to why our mind is reacting in the way it is. Why do others react differently and not get stressed by the same situation? This curiosity opens the door to learning about ourselves and how our minds work, which leads to emotional intelligence. This intelligence illuminates our thinking, and as a result many problems can dissolve, or we can deal with the challenges we face with a calm mind.
                </h4>

                <h4 class="mtb0px blog_desc">
                  <span class="blog_highlight_black">
                    With this clarity we can be mentally healthy, less stressed and anxious, have better relationships, be happier, avoid and overcome addiction, and live with a positive and more generous attitude, being grateful and celebrating what we have, rather than moaning about what we don’t.
                  </span>
                  This can also help us develop our communication and leadership skills, be emotionally intelligent, more resilient, and live with courage and integrity. This approach is simple, but the impact can be profound.
