                  Introduction – Wisdom, which comes from a deeper understanding of ourselves, can lead to greater self-awareness and help relationships flourish. We have so many relationships through our lives – with parents, children, friends and work-colleagues. They can bring us so much happiness, but can be equally heart-breaking if they are dysfunctional.

                </h4>

                <h4 class="mtb0px blog_desc">
                  With 60+ modules the HappierMe app gives you the tools to access your own wisdom, understand your own ego, and then apply this to enhance every aspect of your life, including your relationships. It could help your relationships flourish in many ways:

                <h4 class="mtb0px blog_sub_title">
                  1. Listen with depth
                </h4>

                <h4 class="mtb0px blog_desc">
                  We all have a need to be listened to, but not the same need to listen. Listening with depth is a skill we can all learn, and this can enhance all our relationships.
                </h4>

                <h4 class="mtb0px blog_sub_title">
                  2. Understand what is not being said
                </h4>

                <h4 class="mtb0px blog_desc">
                  Being able to understand others clearly, including what is not being said, can deepen our connection with others, and avoid misunderstandings.
                </h4>

                <h4 class="mtb0px blog_sub_title">
                  3. Speak with care
                </h4>

                <h4 class="mtb0px blog_desc">
                  Wisdom helps us learn to speak with care, and consider how it is going to be received before speaking.
                </h4>

                <h4 class="mtb0px blog_sub_title">
                  4. Be more flexible
                </h4>

                <h4 class="mtb0px blog_desc">
                  Understanding our attachment to our own point of view can help us be more flexible and this can help avoid conflict.
                </h4>

                <h4 class="mtb0px blog_sub_title">
                  5. Criticise others carefully
                </h4>

                <h4 class="mtb0px blog_desc">
                  If we are not aware, the constant criticising of others can strain our relationships. Wisdom allow us to be sparing in our criticism and offer it carefully. 
                </h4>

                <h4 class="mtb0px blog_sub_title">
                  6. Live without Envy
                </h4>

                <h4 class="mtb0px blog_desc">
                  By understanding the unconscious process of comparison in our own thinking, we can learn to only compare ourselves with others only when we need to, and avoid feelings of envy, low self-esteem and resentment – which can reduce stress and relationship conflict.
                </h4>

                <h4 class="mtb0px blog_sub_title">
                  7. Develop emotional intelligence
                </h4>

                <h4 class="mtb0px blog_desc">
                  By understanding ourselves we can better manage our emotions like unhappiness, anger, sadness, or loneliness. This helps us have happier relationships.
                </h4>

                <h4 class="mtb0px blog_sub_title">
                  8. Understand emotional needs
                </h4>

                <h4 class="mtb0px blog_desc">
                  We have many emotional needs we are not aware of which we expect others to meet. When they are not met we get hurt, and angry. Understanding them allows us to respond with wisdom.
                </h4>

                <h4 class="mtb0px blog_sub_title">
                  9. Be kind
                </h4>

                <h4 class="mtb0px blog_desc">
                  Our mind is usually thinking of itself and how its needs can be met. This leaves no space for kindness. Realising this allows us to respond with wisdom, and go out of our way to be kind to others.
                </h4>

                <h4 class="mtb0px blog_sub_title">
                  10. Develop a positive attitude
                </h4>

                <h4 class="mtb0px blog_desc">
                  A positive attitude is something we need to consciously develop, because our minds have a natural negativity bias. This allows us to overlook the faults in others.
                </h4>

                <h4 class="mtb0px blog_desc">
                  'The beginning of love is to let someone be perfectly themselves, without trying to fit them into our image’  - Thomas Merton
                </h4>

                <h4 class="mtb0px blog_sub_title">
                  11. Realise that your anger comes from you
                </h4>

                <h4 class="mtb0px blog_desc">
                  Wisdom allows us to understand that our anger comes from ourselves – it’s a reaction to a feeling of being hurt or disappointed. Anger can harm relationships and this understanding allows us to respond with wisdom.
                </h4>

                <h4 class="mtb0px blog_sub_title">
                  12. Receive criticism without reacting
                </h4>

                <h4 class="mtb0px blog_desc">
                  Being able to receive feedback and criticism with intelligence is a skill we can all learn. Being open to listen to negative feedback and act on it can keep all our relationships healthy, for the long term.
                </h4>

                <h4 class="mtb0px blog_sub_title">
                  13. Understand expectations
                </h4>

                <h4 class="mtb0px blog_desc">
                  In all our relationships we carry many expectations of how we want others to behave. When these expectations are not met we can get hurt, get angry and this can strain our relationships. A deeper understanding of where our expectations come from allows us to respond with wisdom.
                </h4>

                <h4 class="mtb0px blog_sub_title">
                  14. See people freshly. Be grateful.
                </h4>

                <h4 class="mtb0px blog_desc">
                  Our mind usually takes what it already has for granted and focuses on what it does not have. Wisdom allows us to be grateful for what we do have, and see people freshly.
                </h4>

                <h4 class="mtb0px blog_sub_title">
                  15. Learn to love
                </h4>

                <h4 class="mtb0px blog_desc">
                  Wisdom allows us to love others for their sake, and not just because of what they do for us. Love is acceptance, and wisdom allows us to accept people as they are and not try and change them.
                </h4>

                <h4 class="mtb0px blog_sub_title">
                  16. Learn about yourself
                </h4>

                <h4 class="mtb0px blog_desc">
                  Relationships offer a mirror in which we can learn about ourselves and grow as human beings. Every reaction we have teaches us something new about ourselves – if we are open to learning.
                </h4>

                <h4 class="mtb0px blog_sub_title">
                  17. Learn to forgive
                </h4>

                <h4 class="mtb0px blog_desc">
                  To keep relationships healthy, we must learn to forgive others and overlook what we perceive to be their faults. Wisdom awakens compassion and makes forgiveness easier, because we see that deep down we are the same human being.
                </h4>

                <h4 class="mtb0px blog_sub_title">
                  18. Have deeper, more meaningful connections with others
                </h4>

                <h4 class="mtb0px blog_desc">
                  It is beautiful when our relationships have depth and meaning - we feel closer to others, and less lonely. To get closer to others we need to overcome our fear and be more vulnerable – sharing what we really feel. Wisdom can help us do this.
                </h4>

                <h4 class="mtb0px blog_sub_title">
                  19. Learn to respect differences
                </h4>

                <h4 class="mtb0px blog_desc">
                  We become unconsciously attached to our own conditioning and want others to think and behave like us. Wisdom allows us to respect differences because we have a deeper understanding of what is going on in our own thinking.
