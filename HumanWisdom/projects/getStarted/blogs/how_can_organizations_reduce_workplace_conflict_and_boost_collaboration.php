                  How can organisations boost collaboration?
                </h4>

                <h4 class="mtb0px blog_desc">
                  In this article we are going to explore how helping everyone develop a deeper self-awareness and self-understanding may help reduce tribalism and boost collaboration in organisations.

                <h4 class="mtb0px blog_desc">
                  But first, here is a story which illustrates the problem.
                </h4>

                <h4 class="mtb0px blog_desc">
                  <span class="blog_highlight_black">
                    I visited the 9/11 memorial in New York
                  </span>
                  recently and was moved by the beautiful water feature where the towers once stood and the wonderful museum with moving stories of bravery on the day.
                </h4>

                <h4 class="mtb0px blog_desc">
                  <span class="blog_highlight_black">
                    What also struck me was that many intelligence agencies had information that could have prevented the attacks,
                  </span>
                  and had they shared it readily with each other, the attacks could have been prevented. But each agency seemed to be in a competition for importance and influence and as a result intelligence sharing did not happen. Each agency thought only about protecting its own influence rather than about the common good, without exception. It is easy to blame individuals or leaders, but the origin of the problem is deeper, and linked to the way our minds work.
                </h4>

                <h4 class="mtb0px blog_desc">
                  This problem is also rife in organisations where 
                  <span class="blog_highlight_black">
                    one department is at odds with another,
                  </span>
                  and colleagues in the same department are sometimes in conflict with each other. This contributes to low productivity, poorer outcomes, and increased risk. It can also result in a loss of life, for example in hospital environments where teams are not communicating effectively. In the UK 10 million employees report workplace conflict. 900,00 workers took time off due to this (ACAS).
                  <span class="blog_highlight_black">
                    In the US the cost of workplace conflict is estimated at $359 billion/year (CPP Inc., 2008).
                  </span>
                  Companies with a poor corporate culture report a 48% turnover of staff, compared to 13% where there is a healthy one (Columbia University, 2012).
                </h4>

                <h4 class="mtb0px blog_desc">
                  To address any problem, we need to explore the root cause, and in this case it lies in a deeper understanding of how the human mind is wired. There are four hidden drivers in our thinking that contribute to the problem.

                    Conditioning:
                  </span>
                  We are all conditioned by our environment and past influences. We are not aware of this, and yet become attached to our conditioning. This becomes our ‘normal’ and shapes our opinions and beliefs. Anyone we meet who is different is ‘wrong’ and we either avoid them or try to convince them of our point of view. Conflict follows.

                  This is also an unconscious process. If I belong to ‘Department A’ that becomes my identity, and I am at odds with ‘Department B’. We compete for influence and resources in the organisation. This turf war does not serve the organisation as a whole.

                    Self-interest:
                  </span>
                  Our hidden self-interest operates in the background, shaping our thoughts and actions. We are not always aware of it. In any meeting we are always looking out for ourselves and resist anyone else gaining influence, even though they may not be interfering in our work in any way, and they may be right. Our self-interest stops us living with integrity and collaborating with others for the common good.

                    Comparison:
                  </span>
                  The unconscious process of comparison operates in the background in all of us. If others are better in some way it generates a feeling of envy and resistance, and we blame others for how we are feeling. We often act then to pull the other person down and conflict follows.

                  A deeper understanding of these hidden drivers in our thinking can help us put them to one side and collaborate with others for the common good. It can also reduce interpersonal conflict.

                <h4 class="mtb0px blog_desc">
                  Organisations can help by training staff in self-awareness, for their own personal growth. A natural by-product of this is better collaboration and reduced conflict. To be effective this training cannot be done as a one off event because it is quickly forgotten. Regular group discussions combined with the use of the app and the built in online journal help users go on a journey of self-awareness, and it is this that brings transformation.
