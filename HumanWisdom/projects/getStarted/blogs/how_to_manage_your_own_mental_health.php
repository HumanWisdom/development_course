                  There is an epidemic of mental health challenges in the world today. This article explores a fresh way of taking charge of your own mental health by understanding your own mind so you can be in charge of it, and determine how you will think, feel, and react. (If you have a serious mental health condition this article may help, but you should also seek professional help).

                  Has it always been this bad or are we just measuring it better? Has life become more challenging and uncertain? Is social media to blame? Are people becoming more selfish and are more relationships in trouble? Are people less resilient now? The explanations don’t matter because they do not help the person who is suffering now.

                <h4 class="mtb0px blog_desc">
                  Our mind assumes our emotional distress comes from the outside, from our lack of money, or our job, or the conflict in our relationships, or our health - and to some extent that is true, but it is not the whole picture.

                <h4 class="mtb0px blog_desc">
                  In every situation there is an external trigger and then an internal reaction in our own mind. It is the reaction that creates our suffering because different people react differently to the same trigger.

                <h4 class="mtb0px blog_desc blog_highlight_black">
                  By realising that we cannot control our circumstances but we can change how we automatically react to them, we can take charge of our own mental health.

                <h4 class="mtb0px blog_desc">
                  The first step is to calm your mind so you can notice what you are thinking and feeling. Otherwise, it is like trying to study a snowflake in a snow storm of thoughts and emotions. When we are triggered, this is what it can feel like.

                  With a calm mind you can also create a pause between the external trigger and the internal reaction, allowing you to use your intelligence to decide how you want to respond.

                  This acceptance is not easy to do.

                  </span>
                  when the problem is being created by someone else?’, is a common question we automatically ask ourselves. If I think work is causing my stress, my employers need to change, or if I think my partner is causing my stress then they need to change.

                <h4 class="mtb0px blog_desc">
                  The answer is simple - because

                  </span>
                  and not be distressed, because that distress is impacting your mental and physical health. This does not mean that the situation does not have to be dealt with - it is just that you can do it better with a mind that is calm and capable. The only person you have control over is yourself, so begin there.

                  are perhaps the two most important skills you need on this journey of learning about yourself. We had this curiosity as children and need to rediscover it for ourselves. With curiosity we can study what we are thinking or feeling and explore why.
