            This need for  approval in us is so powerful that sometimes our idea of success becomes what others think of us. This often happens without our awareness. 
          </p>

          <p>
            We judge others based on how famous they are – even if they are famous for just being famous – the modern social media influencer. On social media the currency of success has become how many followers people have.
          </p>

          <p>
            We can judge the success of our lives based on how much recognition we have had – how many papers I have published if I am a researcher, how much status I have achieved in society, how many awards I have had If I am in public service, and so on.
          </p>

          <p>
            Meanwhile, the mind that seeks Need for approval to feel good about itself – remains thirsty. No amount of external validation quenches the thirst of the heart for feeling at peace with itself.
