            If I am a performer â€“ a musician, an actor or a public speaker, and my sense of self-worth is determined by the applause or praise I get, then every time I perform I experience severe anxiety because I am worried about what others will think. It seems so hard-wired into my system that I cannot control it or do anything about it. 
          </p>

          <p>
            Performance anxiety is common among musicians and actors, but also affects people in other professions. It can also affect students who are sitting exams in a similar way. 
          </p>

          <p>
            This feeling of anxiety is heightened if we have experienced this praise before. Many performers take drugs to calm themselves down.
