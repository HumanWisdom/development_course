            Sometimes we feel we need to be loved and appreciated by others before we can love and appreciate ourselves â€“ though we may not be aware of this happening in the background. We live in a culture where achievement is praised and we see people around us celebrating their wins on social media. 
          </p>

          <p>
            If I do not have an achievement I can be recognised for, or people in my life who love me and appreciate me for who I am, I can begin to feel unworthy and bad about myself. Or, if I have not reached the goals I set myself, and see others doing better than me, that can trigger the same feeling. 
          </p>

          <p>
            Social media has exacerbated this phenomenon because there is always someone with more likes and who is more popular.
          </p>

          <p>
            If my feeling of self-worth comes from what others think of me, and my achievements, there is a risk that I will end up depressed with feelings of low self-esteem. I am not aware of the process going on in the background.
