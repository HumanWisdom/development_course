            Hidden from our awareness our mind seeks approval from others in order to feel good about itself. This is not right or wrong, but just a fact that needs to be explored and understood.

            It begins in childhood when we are praised by our teachers and parents for our achievements at school, and can influence our lives in a number of ways we are not aware of.  For example, it can cause feelings of low self-esteem if we do not get praised by others. Or, it can shape our behaviour so that we do things which will make us look good - for example posting pictures of ourselves on social media. We become conditioned to chase this Need for approval all our lives. The pleasure that generates lasts a little while, and then fades, and we need to chase that approval again.

            In this module we will explore why our mind does that, the many different ways that it impacts our lives, and how we can respond with wisdom.
