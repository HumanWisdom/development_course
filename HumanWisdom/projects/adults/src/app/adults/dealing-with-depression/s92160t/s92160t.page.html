            Meditation has been proven to help with depression in many scientific studies.
            The breathing exercises you did in the previous session are a great foundation to begin a meditation practice. It is so simple to begin. We have an entire module dedicated to meditation in the app. There are also several audio meditations you can practise.

            To begin, just find a chair you can sit up straight in - or if you can, sit on the floor with your legs crossed and eyes closed. All you need to do is become aware of your surroundings - all the sounds you are hearing, then notice your body and how it is feeling, then observe your thoughts and feelings as they come and go - and this is the difficult bit - observe them without trying to control them, or judge them. Gradually your mind will quieten. Donâ€™t try to actively quieten your mind - that just leads to frustration and disappointment. All you need to do is be a quiet observer. In the beginning it will not feel easy - that's okay - keep going. It gets better.

            Sit for 10 minutes a day to start with, gradually increasing this to 30 minutes a day. It will take about 8 weeks for you to notice the difference. The key is to begin. If you can do it with a friend it will be much easier - or you can join a meditation or mindfulness class locally.
