            After you get better from a bout of depression, you are vulnerable to feeling this way again - especially if life gets challenging. Once you have suffered depression it can come back.
          </p>

          <p>
            This is why it is important to keep up with everything you have learned about yourself and the illness and stick to the lifestyle changes you have made so far. 
          </p>

          <p>
            Recovering from depression does not always mean you are happy though, and that is another journey you will need to embark on. Review the module on Happiness in the app.
          </p>

          <p>
            The rest of the app is available to help you on this journey including modules on stress, anxiety, relationships, self-esteem, and meditation.
