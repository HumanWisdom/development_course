          <p>
            Our mind makes assumptions of ourselves and others and we automatically attach a label.
          </p>

          <p>
            We may believe we are useless, worthless or will never work again. Or we may think we are unattractive.
          </p>

          <p>
            We also make assumptions of other people in our life - usually looking at them negatively - and thinking the worst of them - people are selfish, uncaring, or mean, for example.
          </p>

          <p>
            Our assumptions are also binary - we label ourselves and others as good or bad, right or wrong - not realising that each person is a mix of many shades of gray - we are just human after all.
          </p>

          <p>
            We repeat these assumptions and so they stick and we never question them. They keep us anchored in old ways of thinking that perpetuate our depression
