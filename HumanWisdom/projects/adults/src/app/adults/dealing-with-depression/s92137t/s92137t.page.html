            This is such a useful skill to learn because it can help you deal with negative emotions and thoughts that are unpleasant to bear.
          </p>

          <p>
            It is based on a simple idea - that behind our negative feelings are negative thoughts. If we can meet a feeling without thinking - just observing it for what it is, without judging it, or even naming it, we can cut off its oxygen supply and we can feel calm straight away.
          </p>

          <p>
            In the quietness that follows we can see more clearly and make sense of what is happening in our thinking.
          </p>

          <p>
            It is simple, but needs practice so donâ€™t get disheartened if you cannot master it straight away.
          </p>

          <p>
            We have an entire module dedicated to it on the app. Do have a look.
