            There are many reasons why we may struggle to accept that we have a mental illness like depression.
          </p>

          <p>
            It may be that we have good careers, feel strong and do not think this could happen to us. Depression happens to ‘other people’, not us.
          </p>

          <p>
            We may feel we are managing our day to day lives, and everyone feels blue sometimes and we are no different . We don’t want to make a fuss and worry others.
          </p>

          <p>
            Or, we may not like having the label depressed - even for ourselves. We like to think of ourselves as healthy - and do not like labels.
          </p>

          <p>
            Or, we may worry what other people will think of us - especially at work and how our loved ones will react. Will they think less of us? Will they still support us and stay in our life, or leave us? 
          </p>

          <p>
            We may be dealing with a major life event like divorce, bereavement or the loss of a job, and we are sure how we are feeling is related to the external event, and will soon pass.
          </p>

          <p>
            Or, we are so overwhelmed with the emotions we just want to escape from them and numb the pain we feel with alcohol or drugs
