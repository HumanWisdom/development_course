            The person who is depressed may be very self-critical. These negative thoughts keep repeating themselves in a loop in their mind and there seems to be no escape. These thoughts seem real so we believe them to be true - but they may not be - it is useful to remember that.
          </p>

          <p>
            They may have many regrets about the past and how they behaved, and cannot forgive themselves.
          </p>

          <p>
            Or they may have feelings of being worthless and less than others, and be critical of themselves for not making more of their life.
          </p>

          <p>
            They may say things like :
            <li>
              I’m not good enough
            </li>

            <li>
              I’ll never be able to feel better again
            </li>

            <li>
              I will never be successful
            </li>

            <li>
              I’m a failure
            </li>

            <li>
              I always disappoint others
            </li>
          </p>

          <p>
            
          </p>

          <p>
            The first step is to identify these negative thoughts and write them down in your online journal on the app - in the next sessions we will explore how to tackle them
