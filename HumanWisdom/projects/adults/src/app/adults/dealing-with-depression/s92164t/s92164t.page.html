            80% of people with depression report problems with sleep - not getting enough sleep at night, or sleeping excessively during the day. 
            A lack of sleep is a risk factor for developing depression and 40% of people with insomnia complain of depressive symptoms.

            What can you do to sleep better if you are depressed?
          </p>

          <p>
            The first step is to realise its importance and make it a priority. Try to sleep at the same time every night and aim for 7-8 hours of sleep. Avoid electronic devices an hour before bed. A hot bath or shower, and a relaxing  breathing exercise before bed can help calm the mind and prepare you for sleep. Try and avoid sleeping during the day as much as possible - or limit your naps to 15 minutes. Regular exercise can help with your sleep at night, as can being outdoors for some time during the day. Avoid alcohol - as it just messes with your sleep cycle.
            Avoid drinking alcohol in the evening as that can disrupt your sleep.
          </p>

          <p>
            Implementing this regime sounds simple, but can be a challenge when you feel depressed. 
            Take baby steps, keep a sleep diary, and every day try to get a little bit better
