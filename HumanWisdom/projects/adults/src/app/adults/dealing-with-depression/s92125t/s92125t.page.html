            Now let’s introduce another element to this exercise.
          </p>

          <p>
            Try this only if you have mastered step 1 and 2 and are comfortable with it. This third step is not always easy - so try it - and if it doesn’t feel comfortable right now, come back to it later.
          </p>

          <p>
            As you breathe in, at the end of your breath, hold it for a count of 2 before you begin to breathe out. As you breathe out, at the end of your breath hold it to a count of 2 before you breathe in again.
          </p>

          <p>
            As you get better at this increase the breath holding count to 4.
          </p>

          <p>
            Being able to control your breath in this way is good for your immune system, and also helps you to control your automatic reactions to your thoughts or external events.
          </p>

          <p>
            Do this for 5 minutes
          </p>
