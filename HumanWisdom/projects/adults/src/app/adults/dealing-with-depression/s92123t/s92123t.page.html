            Here is a simple breathing exercise to try right now.
          </p>

          <p>
            Sit with your back straight in a chair.
          </p>

          <p>
            Close your eyes.
            Take 3 deep breaths and let them out slowly.
          </p>

          <p>
            Now breathe in slowly filling your lungs with air, till you can't take any more air in -  to a count of 4 - 1, 2, 3 4.
          </p>

          <p>
            Now breathe out really really slowly to a count of 8 - 1â€¦8. 
          </p>

          <p>
            Continue doing this for 5 minutes, and then listen to the next audio, where we introduce another element to this exercise. Focus on the breath, and if thoughts come - just observe them, offering no resistance. Learn to detach yourself from your thoughts - just observing them from a short distance. You are your breath right now, not your thoughts.
          </p>
