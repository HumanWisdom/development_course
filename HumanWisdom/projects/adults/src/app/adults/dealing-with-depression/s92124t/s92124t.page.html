            As you continue with the exercise, place your index finger in a horizontal manner just under your nose. Notice how the air coming in is slightly cooler than the air coming out. Do this for 1 minute. Now remove your finger and see if you continue to notice that the air coming in is cooler than the air coming out. 
          </p>

            Focus on your nostrils and the temperature of the air. Keep observing the thoughts that arise, as if from a distance, without judging them or reacting to them. You are not your thoughts - just your breath.

            Do this for 5 minutes
