          This section is probably the foundation of the HappierMe approach. Hidden from our own awareness our minds function in similar ways and shape our thoughts, feelings and behaviour. Understanding how our mind works helps us to understand others since our minds function in similar ways - this can enhance all our relationships. We realise that many of the problems we experience - unhappiness, mental health, relationship conflict, sorrow, and addiction, are caused by the automatic way our unconscious mind reacts to the world - this is neither right nor wrong, but understanding this helps us to live with a deeper intelligence and be in charge of our own lives so we can avoid suffering, make the right choices for ourselves and flourish in the world. Remember - the key here is to be curious, examine your own thinking to see if what is pointed out is true, and not to regard what you observe as right or wrong.
