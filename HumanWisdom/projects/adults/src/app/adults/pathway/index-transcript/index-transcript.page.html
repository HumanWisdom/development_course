            Welcome to Pathway - our carefully designed 5 step guided program to help you develop a calm mind, learn about yourself and how your mind works, grow as a person, and then apply that understanding to enhance every aspect of your life. There is no timeline and you can do it at your own pace. You can skip to topics of interest, or do it in a step wise manner starting with the calm mind section.

            This is not based on a book or an ideology, but on looking and learning about yourself. Doing the actual work of learning about yourself is what brings transformation - helping you be at peace with yourself and others, be mentally healthy and happy, manage your emotions, and develop the soft skills to flourish in the world - communication, leadership, resilience, integrity and empathy. This understanding has the potential of transforming your life and helping you make the most of it. As you begin, be curious and travel with an open mind, not regarding what you learn as good or bad - but like a scientist - just looking and learning about yourself.
