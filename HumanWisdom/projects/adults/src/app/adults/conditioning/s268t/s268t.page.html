            What we want out of life from childhood onwards is influenced by our conditioning and we are not aware of it.
          </p>
          <p>
            While working with several city schools, some of the children in those schools did not see work as something they were interested in, because they were surrounded by adults who had not worked, many for reasons out of their control. If we want to help those who are disadvantaged, the best thing we can do is to give them the gift of this wisdom to question their own conditioning influences. They are not wrong, but just operate in the background. Awareness allows us to make informed choices about our lives.
