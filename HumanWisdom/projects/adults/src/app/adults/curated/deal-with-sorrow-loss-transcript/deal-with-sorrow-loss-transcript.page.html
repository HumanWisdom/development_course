          There are many causes of human suffering and losing things or people we value is the most common. We also suffer when we lose our jobs, or our pets, or our reputation. At its root suffering is caused by the loss of anything we are attached to. Whenever our emotional needs are met we get attached and then suffer if we lose the thing we are attached to. A deeper understanding of what is going on in our thinking that causes us to suffer, gives us the option to respond to our suffering with wisdom. Sometimes our suffering can be so intense that we turn to alcohol or drugs as a way of dealing with it - and that can cause even more problems than the original event. Here you will find tools to help deal with the acute event, and then go deeper to meet it with wisdom. Return here whenever you need to - you will learn something new
