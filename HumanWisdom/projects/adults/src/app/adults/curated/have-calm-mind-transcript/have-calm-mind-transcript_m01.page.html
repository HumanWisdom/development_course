                    Welcome to your personalized dashboard on how you can develop a calm mind. A regular practice can help you have a mind that is better able to meet lifeâ€™s challenges. It allows you to have that tiny pause between a trigger and your response - allowing you that crucial time to respond with wisdom. A mind that is quiet is more sensitive to the beauty of the world.

Nature meditations offer a different way of being in nature that can be very calming. There are several breathing exercises you can choose from - you can do them anywhere. Regular journaling and a formal meditation practice offer other options to consider.  Find something that works for you and then make it a regular practice.
