          <b>breathing exercise.</b> You can also go for a walk or speak to a friend. For long term relief explore the 
          <b>stress and anxiety modules</b> in depth, and explore the 
          <b>guided questions</b> in your journal. Stress is a reaction from our thinking to what is happening in our life. We may not be able to change the event, but can change how we respond. To do that we need to go deeper and understand the origins of stress and anxiety in our thinking. Enjoy the 
          <b>podcasts</b> and 
          <b>short videos</b>. Keep returning here and exploring the material again. You will learn something new each time. Imagine what your life would be like if you could be much less stressed and anxious - it does require some work on your part - but the benefits are surely worth it.
