                    Our emotions are part of being human. It is important not to label them as right or wrong because that can stop us from exploring them. They influence every aspect of our lives and we seem to have little control over them. They arise spontaneously, usually triggered by a thought or an external event. Emotions can be powerful and we may struggle to cope. Desire can influence what we buy, whom we find attractive, and the direction of our lives. A strong desire can suspend our critical thinking and make us do things we may later regret. The sudden feeling of anger can drive us to violence, or envy can make us dislike others, lose confidence in ourselves, and create a heartache we cannot shift. The feeling of loneliness is painful, and can influence our behavior in ways we may not be aware of. You will experience the entire spectrum of emotions over your life - understanding where they come from and how they impact you can allow you to be in charge of your own life and make smart decisions. You can then embrace them fully, knowing they are part of being human, but avoid the many problems they can cause.
