          Welcome to your personalized dashboard where we explore how wisdom can be applied to the workplace and enable us to thrive. We spend so much of our time at work so it is important we enjoy our time there and give our best. It can help us develop a positive attitude to work, have great relationships, communicate well, develop leadership skills, and deal with challenges with less stress and anxiety. It can also help with diversity and inclusion, staff retention, and reduce sickness absence by reducing the stress people feel. Leading with wisdom allows people to thrive and organizations to flourish, creating a workplace where people enjoy coming to work, are creative, and able to give their best. Every quality of leadership comes from wisdom, and not from our education. We also have sections on time management, running a meeting, and how to improve your focus while working. Keep returning and exploring this content - you will always learn something new.
