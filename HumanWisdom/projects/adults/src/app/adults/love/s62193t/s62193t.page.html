          If we care, there are so many things each of us could do to make a difference. We could consume less, eat a mainly plant based diet, plant a tree, and so on. Sometimes our habits get in the way of change. These habits come from our various conditioning influences. I may be familiar with a meat based diet, or be used to taking 3 holidays a year, or buying things as a way of feeling happy, and I feel an internal resistance to change. The climate and environmental crisis feels in the future, whereas I have to deal with the inconvenience of change right now. We explore how we can change our habits in another module. As we continue to look and learn about ourselves, these changes occur naturally.
