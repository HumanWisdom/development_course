          What does loving ourselves mean? We are not talking about being narcissistic but about how 
          we can live in peace with ourselves.<br>
          If we are hurting because we feel we are not good enough, and are critical of ourselves, then that pain becomes our main focus and we cannot love others. If we do not love ourselves, it is also difficult to invite others to love us. To have a loving relationship with others, we need to have a loving relationship with ourselves. In this session we will explore how we can use our wisdom to do that. We have also explored this subject in the module on self-esteem, so do have a look at that as well.
