                            Welcome to this session. In previous sessions we have explored how to notice our thoughts and our feelings, how our thoughts and feelings are connected and how our mind judges all the time.
                          </p>

                          <p>
                            In this session we are going to explore how our mind assumes what it thinks and feels is true and why it does that. This can help us understand others because their mind does the same.
                          </p>

                          <p>
                            The quality of our lives depends on the quality of our thinking. This exercise, and in fact the entire Human Wisdom program aims to improve the quality of your thinking, and explore a space beyond thinking.
                          </p>

                          <p>
                            We are going to explore the importance of being able to doubt our assumptions and question what we think and feel. This is not something that comes naturally to us. We find this difficult because we canâ€™t bear to think we are wrong.
                          </p>

                          <p>
                            Understanding what is going on allows us to live with wisdom which can be life-changing.

                            Lets begin exploring how our mind believes what it thinks - and consider Simonâ€™s story.
                          </p>

                          <p>
                            Simon is 35 and married to Laura. They have 2 young children. They met in high school. He works as a baker and has to work long hours - getting up at 4am to begin baking for the day - and often doesnâ€™t finish till late.
                          </p>

                          <p>
                            Laura is a home-maker and feels she hardly sees Simon and feels resentful that she doesn't get the attention she needs. Laura also feels Simon does not realize how busy her life is looking after the children and the home and she gets no recognition or credit for that.
                          </p>

                          <p>
                            When Simon gets home he expects Laura to have made an evening meal for them, and looked after the home. Often the house is a mess though and Laura hasnâ€™t cooked them a meal and he has to do it with her. He feels unhappy that she is not doing her share of the work and thinks it unfair to have to work all day, and look after the home after that.
                          </p>

                          <p>
                            When he brings it up they end up having an argument and they blame each other for feeling unhappy
                          </p>

                          <p>
                            How can Simon and Laura be happier? Each of them has a point of view which they believe is the correct one.
                          </p>

                          <p>
                            In this situation, Simon and Laura could begin to question their assumptions. The biggest one being that the other person is responsible for my unhappiness.
                          </p>

                          <p>
                            Laura could consider what it's like to be in Simonâ€™s shoes - she doesnâ€™t know how stressful his job is. She expects him to read her mind and anticipate what her emotional needs are. That may be unfair. None of us can read other peopleâ€™s minds. As far as the food is concerned she needs to find another solution because she is so tired at the end of the day. Maybe they could make a plan for the week and cook more on the weekends.
                          </p>

                          <p>
                            Simon could pause and ask what it's like for Laura to look after the children. Maybe she is busier than he thought. He takes her looking after the kids for granted - but perhaps he could show some more appreciation for what she does. Its such an important job. Maybe he could step and cook on some days - it could become a time they enjoy together?
                          </p>

                          <p>
                            Both of them could realize that their unhappiness comes from their own unmet expectations of each other. They could both re-examine these expectations, let some of them go, and find a way of communicating the rest in a kind way. Kindness is the key - and perhaps also accept that
                          </p>

                          <p>
                            All this is simple, but not easy - but well worth doing!

                            Our mind naturally assumes our unhappiness is caused by others, and is certain of this. Often it is our own unmet expectations which are behind our unhappiness. Our expectations come from our own unconscious past influences, which we are not aware of.

                            Sarah works as an admin assistant  in a school. She has 3 other colleagues and  works from 9-5. It's a demanding and busy job but she does not have to work beyond 5pm. She feels there is too much to do - the phone is always ringing, there are letters to type, unhappy parents complaining, and so much to organise. She never feels she gets on top of her work.
                          </p>

                          <p>
                            Her headteacher doesn't complain, but doesnâ€™t appreciate her either. Her colleagues donâ€™t seem as stressed as she is and she thinks it is because they donâ€™t take their job seriously and donâ€™t have high standards for the quality of the work they do. She has had some sick leave because of her stress, and is thinking of going to see her doctor and get some medication to help her. She may even try and get a different job - she is certain her job is causing her stress.

                            How could Sarah change the way she thinks, and could that help her be less stressed?

                            Sarah could look around and ask Janet who also works in the same office and is never stressed, how she manages that? She could just accept that school admin jobs are always busy - if it wasnâ€™t they may not need her. Just because she is busy, doesnâ€™t mean she has to be stressed - she could just focus on doing one thing at a time - and forget about her long list of things to do - though this is not easy when you are stressed. She could be grateful that nobody is critical of her work, and she isnâ€™t being asked to stay behind and do any extra work. She could also be grateful that she has excellent supportive colleagues and that the job is rewarding. She may realise that her mind is reactive and gets easily stressed, and decide to learn some breathing exercises and do some meditation.
                          </p>

                          <p>
                            By accepting things as they are, and being grateful for what she has, her stress could reduce significantly.

                            This is another example of stress - in this case because a relationship is breaking up. Letâ€™s explore Davidâ€™s story.
                          </p>

                          <p>
                            David has been married for almost 20 years. They have 3 young children. Last week his wife announced that she had met someone else and wanted a divorce. He is still feeling shocked -  the marriage wasn't wasnâ€™t perfect, but no marriage is. His shock has given way to a mix of anger, stress, sadness and a worry about the future. He is bitterly angry with his wife for doing this and is thinking how he can get his own back on her. He feels she is responsible for how he feels and she has been selfish beyond measure.

                          <p>
                            When relationships end so much pain and conflict usually follows. Why can the ending of relationships not be peaceful? What is behind all the anger and sadness that follows?
                            We rely on relationships to meet our long list of emotional needs - to be loved, understood, for security, to feel valued and as a balm for our loneliness. When they end we are suddenly faced with our own emptiness, fears for the future, and a feeling we are not valued - this hurt quickly turns to anger, and we blame others and want to punish them for making us feel this way.
                          </p>

                          <p>
                            Here is another way of seeing the same situation. A relationship is not a prison. People do have the freedom to leave. I would like that freedom for myself if I was unhappy. Yes - I am sad - but that sadness comes from within me - my fear, loneliness and feelings of not being loved. I will deal with that and recover. If I have loved this person who wants to go, Iâ€™m going to let them go with my blessings so they can find happiness where they go. There is no point being with someone who does not want to be with me. It's an opportunity to take stock and look to the future. I will not wallow in self-pity or allow anger or bitterness to get the better of me. I want to see what I can learn to be a better person - and maybe another relationship will follow. I will see.
                          </p>

                            We can make assumptions about what others are thinking and this can lead to anxiety. Consider Amyâ€™s story.
                          </p>

                          <p>
                            Amy is 20. She finished high school but has not gone on to college or to get a job. She has been at home for the last 18 months. She is really anxious about what other people think about her and it's her social anxiety that has kept her at home. When she is around other people she gets so stressed that she feels she cannot breathe properly - and so feels itâ€™s better to stay at home. The thought of meeting new people or being in a group fills her with dread.
                            Her parents have tried to get her to get some help, but she has refused. Her relationship with her parents gets strained

                            How can Amy feel less anxious? 
                          </p>

                          <p>
                            As a first step Amy could realize that her anxiety is linked to her thinking because when she is thinking about something else her anxiety eases.
                          </p>

                          <p>
                            She could then begin to question her assumptions. Are people really thinking about her as she thinks? Or, are they too busy thinking about themselves?
                          </p>

                          <p>
                            And why does she assume they are thinking bad things about her? That may not be true.
                            Why does it matter so much anyway? The people she is close to love her anyway - and you cannot be liked by everyone - after all - she doesnâ€™t like everyone she meets - so why should others?
                          </p>

                          <p>
                            She could also ask if she likes herself - and if not - what gets in the way? Or - is she waiting for others to like her before she likes herself?
                          </p>

                          <p>
                            All these questions will help Amy to let go of her social anxiety.

                            Our mind assumes our anger comes from the outside. Consider Stevenâ€™s story.
                          </p>

                          <p>
                            Steven is 55 and works as an executive in a bank. He has a short temper and he knows it. He tries to control it but often that does not work. He gets angry when driving to work if he thinks people are driving poorly, or in a restaurant if he thinks the service is too slow.
                          </p>

                          <p>
                            He gets angry with his wife when he goes home if the house is not clean and tidy. If the children are making too much noise or watching too much television he tells them off. He also gets angry if they do not get the grades he expects of them in their exams. He thinks he is doing this for their own good. He is angry at work if he feels his junior staff are not working hard enough. Everyone seems scared of him - even his children. He realizes his anger makes him stressed, but he just wishes people would step up and do what they needed to do.
                          </p>

                            How can Steven become less angry by questioning his assumptions?
                          </p>

                          <p>
                            The first assumption Steven needs to question is that his anger comes from the outside - and the way the world is. It is natural for the mind to assume this - but it is not true. His anger arises when there is a difference between how things are, and how he wants them to be. He does not see this. This could make him take responsibility for his anger and at least not blame others for it. If he did want to change something or express his displeasure he can do it in a kind way and without getting angry.
                          </p>

                          <p>
                            Realizing that his anger comes from his own expectations on how things should be could help him to question these assumptions and let many of them go - and accept things as they are. Everyone is different and doing their best. If he was kinder, he may get the best out of people
                          </p>

                            Our mind assumes our anger comes from the outside and we are quick to blame others for it. But in truth it comes from our own unmet expectations and our own disappointment. If the world is not as we want it, we can get angry. The patterns of anger often repeat themselves.

                            Josh is 17 and in high school. He finds school life tough. He has lost interest in school because he does not think he is clever and his friends Sarah and James get better grades than him. He hates exams and the inevitable comparing of grades when the results come out. â€˜What did you get?â€™ - is one one of his most dreaded questions. The Maths teacher has told him on more than one occasion that he needs to try harder - but he feels â€˜Why botherâ€™ - because he will never be as good as his friends. He studies enough to get through the exams but finds them stressful. Because he is not interested in studying he plays up in the class, and tries to be funny because he is just bored. This gets him into trouble - and he dislikes school even more. He canâ€™t wait to get out of school.

                            How can Josh feel better about himself and his time in school?

                          <p>
                            He could begin by questioning his assumption that he is not clever. He could realize that just because others have better grades than him does not mean he is not clever. Perhaps he could work harder, or ask more questions in class if he does not understand something.
                          </p>

                          <p>
                            He could realize that his mind is comparing itself with others all the time and feeling bad if others are better. This does not serve him - and is making him dislike himself, dislike others, and lose interest in the subject. He could also accept that exam grades are not a great predictor of how well people do in life - character is perhaps more important. As long as he does his best he could be happy with whatever grades he gets. He could realize that being disruptive in class is not being kind to others who want to learn, and he could change.
                            What do you think?

                            We assume that we are not good enough because others are better, and convince ourselves we will never be able to do something we actually would like to do or achieve. This is worth questioning.
