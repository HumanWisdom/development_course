                            Welcome to this session where we are going to explore the link between our thoughts and feelings.
                          </p>

                          <p>
                            Thoughts and feelings are intimately connected, though sometimes it is difficult to see the link between the two – because our feelings can arise so suddenly – like our anger when we are criticised.
                          </p>

                          <p>
                            Other than feelings which are linked to the body like hunger, thirst and pain, all our emotional feelings are a reaction from our mind – so must be linked to thinking, even if the link is not obvious.
                          </p>

                          <p>
                            We are going to explore what thought patterns lie behind common feelings we experience.
                          </p>

                          <p>
                            We will also explore how a feeling can trigger a shower of thoughts that we can struggle to make sense of and cope with.
                          </p>

                          <p>
                            Bring your curiosity and a mind open to learning as we begin this exploration

                            Behind most feelings is a thought. Each feeling then triggers a shower of thoughts we can struggle to make sense of and cope with. A deeper awareness of this can help us respond with care.

                          <p>
                            Fear is one of our commonest emotions and has an important place in our life – it protects us from harm – but left unchecked it can cause anxiety which affects 20-30% of people.
                          </p>

                          <p>
                            Is it linked to thinking?
                          </p>

                          <p>
                            The next time you feel anxious, if you distract yourself, and think of something else and get absorbed in that, like watching a movie, your anxiety fades away. This suggests that it is linked to thinking – but we seem to have little control over it – both to prevent it, and deal with it when it arises.
                          </p>

                          <p>
                            Another clue is that when we are asleep and our conscious mind is dormant, we are not aware of the fears of the day – though they may surface in our dreams. When we wake up there is a moment without the fear, then our mind can take over automatically.
                          </p>

                          <p>
                            If fear is linked to thinking, then it follows that if we can change our thoughts we can change the feeling

                          <p>
                            Consider the example of Sam, who is about to sit an exam.
                          </p>

                          <p>
                            Sam is really anxious about his exams and his anxiety is eating him up, to the extent that it is interfering with his ability to study. He worries that he may fail, let his family down, that his father will get angry with him, that his friends will do better than him – and he can’t have that, and as a result of his poor results he will get put into a lower set, not get the grades he needs to get into university, not get a good job, and may even end up homeless. He believes all this is going to happen and is sure of it – and it frightens him to death! His teachers have been telling him the importance of exams all year.
                          </p>

                          <p>
                            He plays squash once a week and while he is playing squash he notices he has no anxiety, but every time he thinks about his exams, the anxiety returns. When he sleeps his fear goes away but returns as soon as he wakes up.
                          </p>

                          <p>
                            It is clear from this example that it is not the exams, but thinking about them that is causing his anxiety.

                            He realises he has not failed an exam before and is unlikely to do it again. He realises that he is probably exaggerating the danger here, and imagining the worst possible outcome. If he did not get the grades he was expecting he would be disappointed but would work harder next time. Besides – he knows of several people who went on to do well in life, despite having poor grades in school.
                          </p>

                          <p>
                            Poor grades in an exam does not mean he is inferior in any way - just that he may have different strengths.

                          <p>
                            As a result of this his anxiety fades away. He realises his anxiety was interfering with his ability to study and now he can actually focus better.

                            Helen is a young woman in her 30’s and was driving to work and running late.  Her daughter had not been well that morning. She had asked her friend Jane if she could look after her daughter for the day – after all she had done Jane so many favours recently – including looking after her dog for 2 days while she had gone away. And Jane had said ‘No’ – she was meeting a friend and could not cancel that at short notice. Helen couldn’t help herself and got angry and put the phone down on Jane – she then had to spend an hour getting a babysitter and was really late for work. Her boss was not going to be pleased.

                          <p>
                            She kept thinking how selfish Jane was, how ungrateful, and how she wasn’t going to talk to her again. Wait till Jane asked her for anything in the future!

                            She realised that at the time she had no control over her anger and could not stop herself shouting at Jane. She felt bad about that afterwards.
                          </p>

                          <p>
                            She realised she had got angry because she felt hurt and disappointed that Jane had not agreed to her request. She now accepted that Jane was not under any obligation to say yes – and maybe she did have an important meeting to go to. She accepted that since her anger came from her she needed to accept ownership of her own anger – however disappointed she was with Jane. 
                          </p>

                          <p>
                            She also accepted that if you had small children they were going to fall ill from time to time and that was just life – and work had been pretty understanding when she had turned up late anyway.

                          <p>
                            As a result of changing the way she thought about the situation her anger went away. She rang and apologised to Jane and arranged to meet her for a coffee

                            Anger is a reaction from our thinking to a feeling of hurt or disappointment. By taking ownership of it and changing the way we think about it, our anger can end.

                          <p>
                            Maria has just had an argument with her husband John about whether they should change to buying only organic food for the house. He feels it is too expensive and that there is no evidence that organic food is better. She feels strongly that organic food is kinder for the planet and much healthier – she feels sad that they have so many arguments these days and can’t agree on anything. As a result, she doesn’t feel close to him anymore and that has affected their physical relationship as well. She finds she is now more irritable with him over small things, and he responds by criticising her and that makes her even more mad. Each time they have an argument she feels they grow further apart. She is unsure what she feels – but it is a mix of sadness, disappointment, anger and worry for the future

                            These are not easy questions to ask herself but she explores them seriously. 
                          </p>

                          <p>
                            She realises that she wants John to agree with her – and because he doesn’t, she is disappointed, hurt and a bit angry with him. She is attached to her point of view and he seems to be attached to his. It is not his fault that he has a different opinion. She wants to win each argument, and raises her voice and keeps trying to convince him in different ways. That probably pushes him to resist. The tit for tat is just making the relationship go downhill.
                          </p>

                          <p>
                            She also realises she is angry with him because she feels he does not respect or care for her parents as much as she would like him to.
                          </p>

                          <p>
                            Realising this – she changes tack. She suggests a compromise where she can buy some organic food and he can decide if it makes a difference. She stops trying to win every argument. He becomes more flexible as a result himself and they begin to build bridges. She also lets go of her resentment about his lack of attention to her parents.
                          </p>

                          <p>
                              As a result of being aware of her thoughts and changing the way she thinks about the situation, she stops feeling frustrated and their relationship improves

                            George is a school teacher and has his own home and family but his lifestyle is modest. His wife does not work. His brother Daniel works in the city and has a well paid job and can afford two foreign holidays a year – skiing in the winter and a beach holiday in the summer. He also changes his car every 3 years. George can’t afford any of these things and just can’t help feeling really jealous of his brother. His self-esteem is low, and he feels he is no good. He didn’t even call Daniel on his Birthday. He thinks Daniel is responsible for making him feel bad about himself, and he just shows off whenever he can.

                            George is pondering these questions and suddenly has an insight. He realises that his mind is just comparing himself with others all the time. He is also envious of colleagues at work for one reason or another. His jealousy is not Daniel’s fault but a product of his own unconscious mind comparing itself with others all the time! He has enough for a comfortable life himself and there will always be those who are better off than him – he is better off than many people he knows – but he never compares himself with them.

                            Jealousy is caused by the unconscious process of comparison in our thinking – which we are not aware of. It is nobody’s fault – but waking up to this, and being grateful for what we have, can end it completely.

                            Peter is 40 and runs his own business. His son Alex is 17 and goes to college. They have a strained relationship and this causes him a lot of stress – so much so that he cannot focus at work and is not sleeping well at night.

                          <p>
                            He thinks Alex is lazy and has no ambition or drive. He does not work hard at his studies and is an average student. He sits with his phone all day and doesn’t engage with the family. He showers only once every few days. He seems quite depressed. Every time he says anything to him about his studies or his future or his excessive time on the phone Alex snaps back at him. That really irritates him and he ends up getting angry and they have an argument. That cycle has continued for months now and he doesn’t know what to do.

                            Peter knows he needs to do something different and cannot go on repeating the same pattern because it is not getting him anywhere.

                          <p>
                            He realises that it is his own anxiety about Alex’s future that is making him criticize him all the time – in the hope that will change his behaviour. He has an insight that criticism does not change someone else’s behaviour and can have the opposite effect, because people feel hurt and become defensive.
                          </p>

                          <p>
                            Criticism was also making Alex feel unloved and not accepted for who he was.
                          </p>

                          <p>
                            As a result Peter stopped criticizing Alex. They talked of other things. They started doing things together. He accepted that Alex was never going to get the best grades in his class, and that was okay. Your success in the world depends on so much more than your grades and he had to accept the future was uncertain but Alex would make his own way in life, and he would be there to support him. The most important thing was that their relationship should improve – and It did. His stress dissolved.

                            By changing the way he thought about the situation Peter was able to change his actions, and the feeling of stress changed
