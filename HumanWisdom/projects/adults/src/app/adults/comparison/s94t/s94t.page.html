            We have explored how the process of comparison operates unconsciously and automatically in our thinking and the many problems it can cause. In this session we are going to explore how we can become aware of this process and respond with intelligence and wisdom. As a 13 year old girl said, if we can do that, we would be free.

            For real change to occur, we have to go beyond an intellectual understanding and actually observe comparison operating in our daily lives. It’s the difference between reading a recipe on how to bake a cake and actually going ahead and doing it ourselves, or reading a menu in a restaurant and eating the food.
