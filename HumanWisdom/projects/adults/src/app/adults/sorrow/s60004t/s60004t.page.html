          Welcome to this module exploring sorrow and loss. It is part of the 4th circle of wisdom where we explore our emotions, and it is connected to each of the other circles. 
To be human is to experience the sorrow that comes when we lose what we value - whether its a person, a pet, or our freedom. In this module we explore the many causes of sorrow, the root causes of the pain we experience, and how we can respond to it with wisdom. This understanding can help us deal with it much more effectively and have empathy for the suffering of others.
