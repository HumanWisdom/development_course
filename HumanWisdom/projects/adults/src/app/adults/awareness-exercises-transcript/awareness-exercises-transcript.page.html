            These awareness exercises help to answer the question - What is self-awareness, and how do I get started? I know how to look at myself in the mirror, but I donâ€™t know how to look inside myself. These self-awareness skills can help you make sense of your own mind, and take you on journeys of self-discovery which can then transform your life.

          <p>
            Each exercise takes less than 10 minutes to do and is designed to build your self-awareness skills. It is a step by step exploration of how your mind works - which is the same in all human beings. To get the most out of them, do one a day, reflect on what you have learned, and then apply it during the day. It requires no special skill and everyone can do it - it's just about noticing what is going on in our own mind.

          <p>
            The exercises begin simply by noticing the world around us, then our body, then our thoughts, then feelings, and the link between thoughts and feelings and so on. As with anything you learn, what you get out of this depends on how sincerely you do them, and apply what you are learning about yourself to your life.
