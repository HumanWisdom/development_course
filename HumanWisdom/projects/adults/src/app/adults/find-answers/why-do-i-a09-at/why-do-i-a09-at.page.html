                      Have you noticed that as soon as you get what you want, you lose interest. It could be buying a new phone, or passing an exam, or getting a promotion. The same thing happens when you pursue a person for a friendship or a romantic relationship and they say yes - after sometime the novelty wears off. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Are you curious as to why that is? What is going on in your own mind to make the pleasure that you had anticipated for so long disappear so quickly? How does this impact our lives?
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      To begin we need to understand the nature of pleasure and the role played by dopamine, a chemical in the brain. Our mind is wired to seek something out there, to make us feel good inside. We do that to escape from a deeper emptiness or restlessness we all feel. It's an unconscious and automatic process and part of being human. This is where the feeling of ‘I want’ is born. I feel that when I get a new phone, or car, or go on holiday I will be happy. So we pursue that. The anticipation of getting it gives us a thrill and dopamine is released and makes us feel happy. Once we get what we want though, the dopamine levels decline and we feel empty again. The greater the high, the greater the feeling of emptiness - and then our mind needs to pursue something else to get the same dopamine kick again. The cycle continues.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Our mind is always pursuing the new, because that is what stimulates our mind and releases the dopamine- when we get the thing we want, it becomes old - and does not stimulate us as much - so we need to chase something new. We do not see this process at work in the background - and this can impact our lives in several ways - making us buy things we do not need and go into debt, or need increasing amounts of alcohol which can lead to addiction, or get frustrated and depressed if we don’t get what we want.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Pleasure can be beautiful and is not right or wrong - but understanding what is going on in our own mind allows us to respond with our intelligence so we can be in charge of our own life and the avoid the many problems it can cause.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Continue now to explore the module on pleasure to understand how this process operates in your life, the impact it has, and how you can be in charge of it so it serves you.
