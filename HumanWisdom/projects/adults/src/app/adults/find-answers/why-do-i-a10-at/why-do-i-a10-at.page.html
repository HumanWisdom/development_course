                    <p>
                      Feeling sad when people we love die is part of being human. We are all going to lose things we love - pets, friends, grandparents, parents, and so on. We are also going to lose things we love, or jobs, or our health - all loss creates suffering.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Everyone reacts differently when people die - death is part of the cycle of life and nothing to be frightened of. Some people take it in their stride, and others are affected more severely and can become depressed.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Understanding what is going on in our own mind and what is behind our suffering can help us prepare better for the death of people we love, and respond in healthy ways when it happens to us.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      It is logical that the extent of our suffering depends on how attached we were to that person, and how much they fulfilled our deepest emotional and physical needs. The closer we are to people, the more suffering we experience. When a distant relative passes we donâ€™t suffer as much. If the person was the main bread winner in the family and we were not only emotionally, but also physically dependent on them - then we can be afraid for the future and that adds to our anxiety, and our suffering.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      It is important to remember that all feelings pass, and this feeling will as well.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Recovering from our suffering is a journey, and when we can completely accept what has happened, our suffering eases and we can move on with our lives. Each person takes their own time to do this. This does not mean we forget people, but we accept all the consequences of their passing.
                    </p>

                      Continue now to explore the module on Sorrow and Loss which goes into the subject in more detail. It offers a guided journey to recover from your loss, whatever it may be. A deeper understanding of what is going on in our mind can also help us prepare for losing people and things we love and respond in healthy ways.
