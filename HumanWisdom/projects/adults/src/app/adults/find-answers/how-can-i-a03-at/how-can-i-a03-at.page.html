                      Of all the skills we are not taught anywhere is our education, communicating with care is perhaps the most important.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      It can contribute to the success of all our relationships - in our personal and professional lives, and help you be a better leader.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Most people aren’t good at it - they don’t listen with curiosity and real interest in what you may be saying, or are distracted, or interrupt you while you are talking, and so on. They also don’t speak with care - pausing to reflect on how it may be received, or are critical all the time, or only speak about themselves. Understanding what another person really means is an art, especially what they may be feeling and not saying.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      It is easier to notice this in others, rather than ourselves.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Noticing that others are interrupting you is awareness. Noticing you are interrupting others is self awareness. Asking why your mind is interrupting others as they speak and exploring that further is emotional intelligence, and can lead to change, helping you be a better listener.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      So, how can we acquire this core skill, which can help us flourish in so many ways. The first step is to realise there is something important to learn - that needs humility. To learn any skill takes time and energy and this si no different. You will reap what you sow.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      There are 2 key steps involved - first, to be aware of how we listen, speak and understand, and then to be curious and ask a question - what is going on in my mind that makes me listen and speak as i do. That deeper awareness brings change.
                    </p>
