                      Our mind is a habit forming machine - it loves to automate some tasks, which we call  habits so it can do with less energy. If we do something regularly our mind wants to make it easier for us to do it again. For example if we drive the same route to work every day, we can do that while thinking about something else while driving.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Some habits are helpful and make our life easier, like our morning routine. Other habits though do not serve us - for example smoking, or drinking or browsing social media for hours, or not looking freshly at the world around us and taking what we already have for granted.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      So, how can we change the habits that do not serve us? It is not easy, and willpower alone is not enough.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      The first step is to become aware of the habit and observe in slow motion how our mind recreates that habit. For example - to observe your hand reaching for the phone or box of sweets you see. This needs self-awareness.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      The next step is to observe the external trigger or the internal thought or sensation we feel that makes us repeat the habit.. For example the sight of a pudding can make us reach for it, without even being aware we are doing so. Or a thought of buying something may precede us reaching for the phone. Or a certain inner restlessness can make us reach for a drink.
                      <br>
                      This needs a greater sensitivity.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      The third step is to not give in to the habit, nor to fight it, but instead to remain with the sensation we feel just before the habit is triggered.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Understanding the hidden triggers that are behind our habits can help us become in charge of our own mind and start making small changes. Start by changing habits that are easy to change - like your route to work, and then add some things you donâ€™t normally do - like walk to the shops, or do a drawing, or read a poem out loud. This breaks up the pattern of thinking and action and makes it easier to change the habits we want.
                    </p>

                      Continue now to explore the module on Habits and Addiction that goes into the subject in depth. All our unhelpful habits and addictions can be broken - but it needs perseverance. Lets get started.
