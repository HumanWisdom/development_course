                    <p>
                      We are all going to be hurt sometimes - it's part of being human. That feeling can make us angry, damage our relationships, try and retaliate in some way, and carry the pain of that hurt with us all our lives, without realizing we are doing so, or the impact it is having on our life.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Without this forgiveness, the cycle of violence continues in our life and in the world, and the people impacted may not even be the ones who caused the hurt in the first place.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      How can we learn to forgive others and free ourselves of the pain that we carry in our hearts?
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      The first thing to realize is that forgiveness is a gift we give ourselves, so our own hearts can heal and we can feel the sunlight of joy in our lives again.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Once we decide that it is in our interest to forgive others, then we can take the next step and explore the pain we felt - and each person’s circumstances will be different.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Our pain could have been caused by an unmet expectation - someone did not invite us to their party, for example, or failed to keep a secret.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      We need to ask if our hurt was caused by our own expectation rather than by a deliberate attempt to harm us. Was it our perception of what happened that caused our hurt - and may be it wasn’t intentional.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Sometimes we may be the victims of a crime, or a tragedy in a wider conflict, or a child may have been injured - there may have been a deliberate attempt to cause harm. We can’t know what was going through someone else’s mind to make them behave in the way they did. They might have been hurting themselves, from some event in their past. Getting to know people and their stories can help us forgive and move on - for example in the Truth and Reconciliation Commission in South Africa after the end of Apartheid there.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      There are so many examples of people who have forgiven previous enemies and now work with them for peace.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Continue now to listen to this discussion on forgiveness which explores why its in our best interest to forgive others, and how we can do that.
                    </p>
