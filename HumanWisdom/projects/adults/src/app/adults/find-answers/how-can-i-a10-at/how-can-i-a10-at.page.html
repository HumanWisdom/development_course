                      In most surveys 1 in 5  people report feeling bullied in school or at work, and 1 in 3 report online bullying, so you are not alone.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Bullying can make us feel terrible, get stressed and anxious and if persistent can damage our mental health.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Most of the time the person doing the bullying is not aware of their own behaviour and the impact it is having on others. They may be suffering inside and bullying others is their form of release to make them feel better about themselves. Or, they may have been bullied themselves and regard this behaviour as normal.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      The issue gets more complex when we realise that sometimes the other person may have no intention to bully us, but we can misinterpret their behaviour as bullying. For example, when we are criticised by someone - that can make us feel bad and we can think that is bullying, when it is not.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Bullying may also not be overt and can take many subtle forms - excluding someone from a group or posting negative comments about them online can also be a form of bullying.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      We also need to know how to overcome the emotional distress we feel when we are bullied and there are many resources within the app to develop a calm mind - journaling, tapping and breathing are all practical things you can do.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Once you feel better, there is no question that bullying behaviour needs to be addressed  - by speaking to the person concerned or by contacting someone in authority. Standing up to bullies can be frightening though, especially if they are bigger or stronger, or in a position of authority. It needs real emotional intelligence and courage to do that effectively.
                    </p>
