                    <p>
                      Have you ever been in a heated argument with people having different opinions and trying to convince each other they are right?
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Or noticed how you like people who agree with you and dislike people who don’t? Or noticed how people repeat the same opinion over and over again in the hope that the other person will finally agree? And noticed how we are rarely curious about others and their opinions, but more keen to repeat our own?
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Most of the time we are not aware this is what our mind is doing but now you are aware of this - you will see it around you all the time.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Now pause and consider what that is - and why our mind responds in these predictable ways?
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      To find out you need to be curious and have an open mind. This understanding can enrich your life in many ways - improve your relationships, make you emotionally intelligent, and open up opportunities for learning.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      All our opinions come from our various conditioning influences we may not be aware of - what we saw on TV or social media, or read in a paper or what our family thinks. None of our opinions are original - they all come from somewhere - but we think they are originally ours and get attached them - we identify with them as ‘my opinion’ and then the ego kicks in wanting to defend them and convince others we are right and they are wrong. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      When someone tries to convince you of their opinion, notice how much resistance you have - so convincing others of our opinion seems equally futile.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      So what is the intelligent approach? By aware of what is going on in our thinking we can become less attached to our own opinions, more curious about the views of others, and always be willing to change our mind when the facts change. This can help us avoid making mistakes in our personal and professional lives. This comes naturally when you live with this inner intelligence.
                    </p>
