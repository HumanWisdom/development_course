                      30% of people in Britain are obese, and that rises to 42% in the US - that is much more than just being overweight - its a body mass index or BMI of 30 or more.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      In addition around 7.8% of people worldwide have an eating disorder, which is a mental health condition where you use the control of food to cope with feelings and other situations.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Both are linked to many diseases and mental health conditions.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      It is clear we need to develop a healthier relationship to food to avoid these problems - but how can we do that?
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      We eat food for many different reasons. We eat when we are hungry and to stay alive - but we also eat for pleasure, in response to emotional distress, for comfort, out of boredom, and to celebrate notable events in our lives - like birthdays. Sometimes we mistake thirst for hunger. Eating more food that our body needs leads to obesity. A greater awareness of our own body, and being able to regulate our own emotions could help us avoid this.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Eating disorders are often linked to emotional distress and our inability to deal with strong emotions. If we were able to better manage our own emotions in response to the challenges we face, we could have a healthier relationship to food.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      There are also many hidden drivers in our own mind that govern our habits around food - not only the amount but also the type of food we eat. These include our conditioning influences, our need for pleasure, our boredom and stress and anxiety.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      If we lived with emotional intelligence, which comes from a deeper self-awareness and understanding of our own mind, we could have a healthier relationship to food.
                    </p>
