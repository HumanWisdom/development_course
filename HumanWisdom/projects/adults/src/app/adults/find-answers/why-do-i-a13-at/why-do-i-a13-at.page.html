                      Do you find yourself scrolling your phone without reason, or skipping the TV channels looking for something to watch, or feeling restless and bored and not know what to do with yourself, or turning to food and drink to ease that feeling of boredom you may feel?
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      You are not alone - and this feeling is part of being human.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      This feeling of inner boredom or emptiness can feel really uncomfortable and we may not know what to do. The usual way we respond to it is by doing something to distract ourselves- and there is nothing wrong with that - but the feeling does not go away. Sometimes our distractions may end up making our life worse - and lead to dependence on alcohol, drugs, gambling, or shopping for things we do not need. Internet addiction is common and the problem with stimulation is that the more we stimulate the mind, the more it needs. Phone use can quickly go from an hour a day to 8 hours a day if we are not watchful.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Would you like to explore a different way of dealing with this feeling?
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      The first step is to become aware of it in ourselves. We may be so busy distracting ourselves that we do not notice it.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      The second step is to stay with that feeling and do a breathing exercise, journal how it feels and notice how it shapes your behaviour, or do a meditation or a tapping exercise.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      The third step is to explore the module on inner boredom, where we go into detail of what is behind the feeling and explore different ways we could deal with it so it transforms to a sense of peace. That feeling of peace is amazing.  Let's get started.
