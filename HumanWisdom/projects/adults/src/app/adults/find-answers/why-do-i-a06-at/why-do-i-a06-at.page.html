                    <p>
                      Have you noticed how selfish people sometimes are? It is easier to notice this in others than in ourselves.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      It can take many forms - not sharing what we have with others, wanting to dominate a conversation and not let others speak, or in every encounter thinking 'what's in it for me’. We like people who make us feel good and do things for us, and lose interest in people who don’t. This selfishness is also behind the corruption and dishonesty we see in society. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Most of us are not aware of the hidden self-interest operating behind the scenes in our own mind, directly our thoughts and actions. We don’t like to admit it in ourselves or be called selfish - but find it easier to spot in others and can be critical of them for being selfish.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Have you ever seen bees in a bee hive - they lead completely selfless lives, toiling away to collect nectar from flowers and taking it back to the beehive to make honey. This self-interest, which is at the heart of being human makes it difficult for us to collaborate and come together, to solve problems for the collective good of us all - we have not been able to address climate change, or war, or clean up political life for example.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      So what is going on to make us behave this way?
                      <br>
                      Behind our self-interest is the sense of ‘I’ - an identification with our body and all our memories, from where our stories about ourselves, our opinions and beliefs come from.
                      This is the way our mind is wired, but some people are more selfish than others - depending on their past experiences. This ‘I’ is always looking out for itself - notice how much time you spend thinking about yourself for example.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      To explore this we need to be curious and have a mind open to learning about itself. We need to suspend judgement and not regard being selfish as right or wrong, but instead try and understand why we are wired to behave in this way.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Continue now to explore the module on self-interest. Understanding this process of self-interest in ourselves can help us live with integrity, be more loving and understand others better, and make better decisions for ours lives.
                    </p>
