                    <p>
                      You may have heard of the word emotional intelligence and how important it is for us, but may be a bit vague on the detail. Lets dive in and find out more.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      There are many definitions out there but the one we like at HappierMe is that Emotional intelligence is the ability to understand and manage our own emotions and apply that to self-regulate our behaviour, our habits and our mental health. It can help us live in peace with ourselves and others.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Emotional intelligence, which comes from self-awareness and a deeper understanding of ourselves can also contribute to our success in life - it can help boost our communication and leadership skills, make us more resilient, and help us make better decisions.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      The more we understand ourselves and our own emotions, the easier it is to understand others, because deep down we are the same human being.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      For example if we understand that our thoughts, beliefs and our automatic behaviours are a product of all our past influences which we are not aware of, it helps us to understand that others are the same - and have more understanding and compassion for them.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      To become emotionally intelligent we need to go on a journey of learning about our own mind, observing our thoughts, feelings and actions and exploring what lies behind them. We need to do this without judging ourselves as good or bad, right or wrong. It is simple, but the impact on our lives can be profound.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      We can manage our own mental health, deal with challenges without getting anxious or stressed, have happier relationships, avoid the perils of addiction, and develop our soft skills to succeed in life and at work.
                    </p>
