                      The fear of death is part of being human and affects people of all ages - once a group of 18 year olds said that after exams, death was their biggest fear.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Most people think about their own mortality when faced with the death of someone they know - usually a grandparent when you are younger, and a parent when you get older.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Normally we don’t think of death and just get on with our lives.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Exploring the subject for ourselves and facing up to our fears around dying can help us lead a richer life. Many cancer survivors for example say they appreciate their life and all the people in it much more now because they know they can't take the future for granted. Actually none of us can - we all have to go sometime - but we forget that. Accepting that fact is not easy - but once you do you notice the beauty around you, take care of the people in your life, don’t get stressed by small things that don’t go the way you want, and let your past memories of pain go so you can live a richer life in the present.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Deep sleep is quite peaceful and death is just a prolonged sleep. Leaving behind the things and people we love is the hard bit - but we can practice letting go now - of our attachment to our past memories, or our sense of importance, or objects in our life. This helps us celebrate our life more fully in the present.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Paradoxically, understanding and getting past our fears of death and accepting it as inevitable, can help us focus on living a richer life today, without fear.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Continue now to explore the next module on the fear of death. It guides you to explore the subject for yourself and get past your fears.
