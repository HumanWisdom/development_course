                    <p>
                      We all want to be happy - ask anyone what they want from their life - and being happy is a core need we all have - but when people are asked why they aren’t happy now they shake their head and say - happiness is hard.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      One way of being happy is to keep chasing something out there to make us feel good in here - nothing wrong with that - it could be the pleasure of good food, or buying something or going on holiday or being with friends. The difficulty is that that feeling does not last long, and we then need to chase something new. Of course if we don’t get what we want we can feel even more unhappy.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      This leads to a pattern of thinking that we will be happy at some point in the future when we achieve something, or do something special.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      But what can we do to be happier right now?
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      One way is to look around and make a list of all the things we can be grateful for right now - our mind takes what we already have for granted and always wants the new - but looking with fresh at our life can make us see wonder and miracles everywhere - in the blue sky, in a tree, or a bird in flight, or the humble tomato. We can be grateful for our breath, for our health, for loved ones - and so on.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Another way to be happy is to explore why we may be unhappy now. It may be we are feeling anxious, or stressed, or think others are better than us, or be critical of ourselves, or have conflict in our relationship, or feel lonely….and so on.
                    </p>
