                      It is normal to feel emotionally distressed from time to time - you can call this by different names - stress, anxiety, anger, sorrow, envy and so on. Each of them are slightly different and triggered by different events. But they do have one thing in common - all of them disturb our peace of mind.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      In that state of emotional distress we cannot think clearly, make bad decisions and feel we are in a fog of unhappiness with no way out.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      This is where practical exercises to calm the mind can help. Fortunately there are many ways you can feel calm right now and you can have access to all of them in the app.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Breathing exercises help to calm your parasympathetic system - slow your heart rate down and help your mind relax - there are about 8 different ones you can practice regularly. If you do them daily for 10 minutes you can gradually regain control over your emotional reactions.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      The online journal is a great way to get the thoughts and feelings out of your head - this can help you feel calm and then come back and examine what you have written. The journal is private to you.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      There are guided audio meditations around different subjects and you can also learn a more formal meditation practice.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Nature is a great teacher and there are wonderful nature meditations which show you a different way of being in nature and being nourished by it.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Finally, we have some tapping exercises you can do, taught by Jondi Whitis, an EFT trainer from Atlanta. They are a simple way to regain control over your emotions.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      There is no right or wrong method - test them all and see which one appeals - or do a combination of them. Whatever you do, it's the regular practice that is the key to a calmer mind. Once you become familiar with them, you can do them anywhere. Let's get started.
