                    <p>
                      Have you ever wondered why we feel hurt when we are criticized? 
                      <br>
                      This is part of being human, but does not always serve us.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Being open to criticism and accepting it with grace could help us self-correct and avoid making mistakes, boost our relationships and help us flourish at work.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      When we are criticized we can feel hurt because we  feel personally attacked, and lash out at people and get angry with them, or go quiet and withdraw our affection from them. Our relationships can suffer.Or,  we could believe what people say is true and feel bad about ourselves. It can lower our self-confidence. Or, we may feel there is nothing wrong with us, and carry on as before.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Finding an intelligent way to respond to criticism needs emotional intelligence and a deeper understanding of what is going on in our mind when we are criticised and when we are critical of others.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Our mind is always comparing what it sees with what it knows - and if there is a difference we can automatically react and be critical of others. So criticism is more a reflection of what the other person regards as normal. Equally, we all have blind spots and it is easier for others to see them, so when someone points something out, it is worth pausing to ask if it could be true, and if we need to change anything as a result. This ability to accept feedback with gratitude, reflect on what has been said and change is the hallmark of an emotionally intelligent person, and a skill we can all learn. Employers value staff who can accept this feedback in a positive way. It can help us get better at whatever we are doing.
                    </p>
