          If we put the same energy that we spend pursuing success in the world, to also be a successful human being our lives would be so much richer and better balanced.  We would do what we needed to do, but also enjoy the journey, have successful relationships, and be happy now, rather than at the end of our journey, chasing the mirage of success. In doing so we could make the most of our time on the planet.
