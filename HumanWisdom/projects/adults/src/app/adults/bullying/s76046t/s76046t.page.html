            Exercising power gives us a certain thrill. Itâ€™s the animal instinct in us - and served us well when we were hunter gatherers, but perhaps not in the modern day, and not when it makes us seek that thrill in dominating others.
          </p>

          <p>
            The human mind is constantly seeking pleasure as a balm for its own inner emptiness and restlessness. We can get that from buying things, from our achievements and also from bullying others and exercising our power over them.
          </p>

          <p>
            The history of mankind and all the wars we have fought are a testament to this - the strong bullying the weak into submission - just because they can - and they always find a way of justifying it to themselves.
