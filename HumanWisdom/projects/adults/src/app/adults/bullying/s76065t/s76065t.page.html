            When we see others being bullied how can we respond?
            A lot depends on the context. 
            If we are in a position to intervene and stop it, we should.
            If we donâ€™t we are complicit in what is happening.
          </p>

          <p>
            Sometimes we may not be in a position to intervene - or we may be afraid of the consequences to ourselves - could we be excluded from the group? We could ask ourselves if we really want to belong to a group where people are being bullied? Being alone is not as frightening as you may think - and you will make new friends.
          </p>

          <p>
            Fear is just a state of mind, and we can overcome it by exploring other ways of thinking about the situation.
          </p>

          <p>
            Is there something else we could do? Perhaps involve others, or speak to someone in authority, or find other ways to support the person being bullied?
          </p>

          <p>
            Evil flourishes when good people are silent.
