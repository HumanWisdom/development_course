            Our mind automatically assumes that others are to blame for how we feel, but how we feel is always a reaction from our own thinking. How we see the situation determines how we feel and how we react to it. Just because we feel offended does not always mean it is the other person’s fault - it could be a problem with our perception of the situation. If we are already disturbed, either because of something that happened earlier in the day, or from an old trauma, we tend to perceive threats where there aren’t any intended.

            Here are some examples that are not bullying:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              Being rude
            </li>

            <li>
              Calling someone a name
            </li>

            <li>
              Pushing them once
            </li>

            <li>
              Having an argument
            </li>

            <li>
              Being criticised for being late to work or for one’s attitude
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            For it to be classed as bullying it must be repeated, with the intention to cause harm - there are always going to be grey areas.
