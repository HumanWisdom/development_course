            It begins in the playground. A kid walks in with a new toy that someone bigger than him wants. He canâ€™t bear not to have it, and the desire to have that is so strong that it overrides any sense of decency and he bullies the little boy to get it.

            The same happens in adult life - except it may be a manager who is under pressure to deliver his targets to get a bonus and in turn bullies all the people who work for him to do so - creating a culture of fear and intimidation without being fully aware he is doing so.
