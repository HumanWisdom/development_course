          We seek external approval to feel good about ourselves. We are usually not aware of this process going on in the background. We feel empty inside and getting others to like us helps us to like ourselves. 
          When people like our posts, or say nice things about us, we feel good about ourselves but can become dependent on this. We need more and more likes on our posts to get the same feeling and if we donâ€™t get these likes we can be disappointed, or If someone is critical of us we can feel hurt and develop feelings of low self-esteem and loss of confidence.
          <p>
            This is an automatic process, and not wrong, but waking up to it allows us to respond in a way that serves us.
