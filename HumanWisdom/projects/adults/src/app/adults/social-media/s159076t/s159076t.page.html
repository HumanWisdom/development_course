          Now that we have explored the impact of social media and the many hidden drivers in our thinking, how can we apply this understanding to respond with intelligence?
          Social Media is not wrong, and cannot be wished away, but we can develop our own strategies on how to deal with it in a healthy way so it serves us, and enhances our lives, rather than be a source of all the problems we have discussed.
          This is not a prescriptive approach and you will decide for yourself which of these will work for you.
