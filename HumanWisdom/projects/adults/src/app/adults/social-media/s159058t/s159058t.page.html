          Our mind is conditioned or influenced by social media in ways we are not aware of. 
          It is a natural process in our thinking and is important in many ways, but does not serve us in others. Being aware of this process allows us to respond with intelligence.
          For example, we are more likely to believe what we read online, especially if it comes from a person we follow. Or if we already have point of view, are more likely to see content which reinforces it - this is how tribes form and conflict begins. 
          Or we may feel a pressure to conform - have a particular body shape, or dress in a particular way, or buy the latest gadget. If we cannot do that then we feel hurt, angry and can feel less than others.
          Because we are not aware we are being conditioned by the thousands of images and posts we read each week, we are not aware how they influence our thinking, our behaviour, and how we feel about ourselves. 
          Every opinion we hold on to and want to defend is a result of our social conditioning.
