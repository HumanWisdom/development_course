          If you sit quietly on your own for 10 minutes, you can see how restless your mind is - the human mind is like that. See how you have the urge to do something to escape from this feeling. In the past it was reading, or watching TV - now it is social media that is most convenient. 
          This is not right or wrong, but just needs to be understood so we can respond with intelligence.
          Browsing our phones fulfills this need and we can get lost in our phones for hours on end.
          Each time we pick up the phone that restlessness eases for a moment. Each time our mind is stimulated by a new post, there is a small release of dopamine and we experience a small burst of pleasure. After each dopamine release we experience a brief period of emptiness which needs to be filled by a new post of video - and that is why scrolling is so addictive.
          The more our mind is stimulated, the more stimulation it needs, and the more restless we feel without it. This is why our phone use gradually increases over time, and the urge to pick it up is strong, and difficult to resist. 
          All this happens automatically and without our awareness.
