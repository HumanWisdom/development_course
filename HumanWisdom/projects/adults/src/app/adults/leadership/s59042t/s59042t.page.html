          We may have an intention to be honest and that is a great start. 
If we are in an environment where dishonesty is the norm, we may be subtly conditioned to think this
 is okay. Everyone else is doing it, so what is the problem? Our mind can justify anything to itself.
We also need to become aware of our self-interest operating in the background, and see how it impacts
 our thinking and behaviour, so in the moment we have to decide, we can make the honest decision, 
 and not one dictated by our self-interest. This self-interest is part of being human and not wrong, 
 but just needs to be understood. Lastly we need to become aware of our unconscious fears which can
  drive us to protect ourselves, for example to cover up a mistake we have made. When that cover-up 
  is exposed our integrity is compromised.
