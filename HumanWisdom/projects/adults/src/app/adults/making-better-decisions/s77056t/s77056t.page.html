            Our minds are restless and want to constantly stay occupied. 
            We need to be stimulated. This is part of being human.
          </p>

          <p>
            We are uncomfortable being alone with ourselves and why we may feel lonely,even in a relationship.
          </p>

          <p>
            This can impact decision making in several ways.

          </p>

          <p>
            The need to have more and more drives most of our decisions.
