            Timing of decisions is often key. Do you need to act urgently - for example if someone is in imminent danger?
          </p>

          <p>
            If you don’t then it is worth giving yourself some time to make that decision. After considering all the merits of what you should do you may have come to a decision - about a job, or buying a house or even whether to marry.
          </p>

          <p>
            It is worth pausing here, and going away and doing other things for a few days. Write things down. When you come back to it your mind will be clearer and you are less likely to be rushed into buying something you don’t need or make a decision you will regret later.
