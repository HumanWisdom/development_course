          Linked to our self-interest is our need for power over others because that makes us feel good. We may not always be aware of this operating in the background. This could impact who we hire, and the relationship we have with others in the organization. We may favor those who suck up to us and do as they are told, and block those who are more independent minded and not interested in flattering us. This power play between different groups and individuals affects all organizations and drains productivity. It also comes in the way of building a more inclusive culture.
