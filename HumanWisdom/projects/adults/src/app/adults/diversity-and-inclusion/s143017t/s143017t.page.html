          There are many challenges in creating a more diverse working environment.

          <ul>
            <li>
              Would you hire a person who is less qualified than another, just to improve the diversity of your organization?
            </li>

            <li>
              Can this create resentment?
            </li>

            <li>
              Or, should we hire based on diversity, but offer the people we hire extra support and training if they need it?
            </li>

            <li>
              Are we aware of our own unconscious biases when screening CVâ€™s, especially when we feel nobody is watching us.
            </li>

            <li>
              There are no easy answers to these questions, but being aware of our unconscious biases and the need for diversity can guide people to make the right decisions
            </li>
          </ul>
