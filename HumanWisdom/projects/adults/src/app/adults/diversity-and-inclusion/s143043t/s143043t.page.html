            Most people are comfortable with their opinions, beliefs, and prejudices. We donâ€™t like them to be challenged, and certainly if an organization we work for says we must, then we can feel an internal resistance - thinking it's just political correctness, or we may think prejudice is a bad thing, but it certainly does not apply to me because I am not prejudiced.
