            Why should we bother examining our own prejudices?
          </p>

          <p>
            We may feel we don't have any prejudices to begin with, and it feels uncomfortable to examine them. We’ve heard about the benefits to the company, but what's in it for me? A part of me thinks it just an exercise in political correctness.
          </p>

          <p>
            Being free of our biases is a gift we give ourselves and helps us grow as human beings. Having a diverse mix of people in our life that can challenge our existing opinions is enriching, widens our perspectives, and allows us to be more successful in whatever we do.
          </p>

          <p>
            Examining our conditioning influences doesn’t just bring freedom from prejudice.
            As we have explored in the module on conditioning, it also reduces stress and conflict
            In relationships, and allows us to think clearly and make better decisions.
