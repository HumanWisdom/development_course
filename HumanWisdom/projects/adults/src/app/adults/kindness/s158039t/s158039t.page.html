            Sometimes we are kind to others in order to get something back from them. It could be we want a favour, or want to join their group of friends, or want them to like us. Observe this in yourself and see if it is true. It is neither right or wrong - just the way our mind works and needs to be understood.
            We may not even be aware that we are being kind because we want something back - but are first aware of the painful disappointment we feel when we don’t get what we want - and get angry at the other person for not returning the favour.
            ‘I did so mu ch for you and you couldn’t even do this little thing for me’ - is the thought that arises and we feel justified in our hurt.
            This form of kindness invariably leads to disappointment, and others can also see through it.
            Its in this cycle of thinking that our minds are caught, and it is one of the main reasons relationships get strained and breakdown. 
            Just observing this in ourselves helps us to let go of any expectations in return for our kindness
