            The first step is to realise the importance of kindness - for yourself, for others, and for the world.</p>
          <p>
            The second step is to ask yourself a question - What gets in the way of being more kind?
            Observe how your mind is self-absorbed, how it is always looking to get its needs met, and how it acts from
            self-interest - willing to do things for others if it's going to get something back. Observe this without
            judgment. This does not mean you are selfish, just human. To break the hidden patterns of thinking, we first
            have to study them, and that is all we are doing.</p>

          <p>The third step is then to look for ways to be more kind in your daily life - whether it's a kind word, a
            smile, thinking of someone in a more positive way, or doing something for someone. You may feel people take
            advantage of your kindness - donâ€™t let that stop you. You are being kind because of who you are, not because
            of who they are.</p>

          <p> Keep a journal of what you did, how your mind reacted when a kindness was not returned, and if you were
            able to rise above that and still be kind</p>
