            Most of us are desperate for praise and equally keen to avoid criticism. We are not aware how these two unconscious forces shape our lives. Praise brings pleasure and criticism brings pain, and the human mind is programmed to want one and avoid the other. This happens without our awareness. In seeking praise we are prone to flattery. If we are in positions of authority we may pick people who praise us as part or our inner circle, and avoid those who may be critical. This can work against us. Our fear of criticism can stop us doing anything original or take a risk, or make us avoid certain people or even some professions. We never learn about our faults, and don’t grow as human beings
