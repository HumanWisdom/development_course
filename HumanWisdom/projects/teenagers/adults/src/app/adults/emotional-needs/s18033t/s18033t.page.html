          These emotional needs in us are powerful and demand to be met. Sometimes when people see the problems they can cause, they think that suppressing them and controlling them is the answer - for example, taking a vow of celibacy. Suppressing these needs does not work and can result in inner turmoil and destroy our sensitivity - they can then express themselves in unhealthy ways. This does not mean that every need can be expressed without regard to the consequences. Understanding them, and what lies behind them, allows us to be at peace and respond with wisdom, so they find their rightful place in our lives.
