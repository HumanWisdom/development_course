            In this module, we are going to explore the many layers of our thinking, some of which are hidden from our view. It is the first step to discovering wisdom. Have a look at this pyramid.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            There are 4 layers to our thinking process, and we are not aware of them all. Layer 1 is what is happening in the world outside.
          </p>

          <p>
            Layer 2 is the content of our memory and all our reactions, thoughts, and feelings. This is where human awareness usually stops. When we talk about the subconscious we are still talking of the content of our memory which we have forgotten.
          </p>

          <p>
            Layer 3 is all the unconscious patterns of thinking that are common to all human beings, like conditioning, comparison, our self-interest, our emotional needs, and so on. These control what we feel and think in layer 2, but we are not aware of it.
          </p>

          <p>
            Layer 4 is the ‘I’ that feels and records everything and it’s where our sense of identity resides.
          </p>

          <p>
            Though this is divided into 4 layers to explain it more easily, we can see them all at once if we have that depth of awareness of what is going on in our thinking.
            Wisdom comes when we are aware of all the four layers of awareness.
