          Fear is part of being human, but when it operates irrationally, it can cause many problems,
           particularly in organisations. We can be afraid of our boss, of losing our job, of what 
           others think of us, of not being good enough, of being criticised, of failure, and so on.
            There may be a culture of fear and intimidation in the organisation as well. The nature of 
            fear is such that it magnifies threats and makes them feel real. Because the problem has not
             yet occurred we cannot solve it and so it continues. It can make us hate going to work and 
             we can't do our jobs properly. Understanding the nature of fear can help us meet it head on,
              and respond with wisdom
