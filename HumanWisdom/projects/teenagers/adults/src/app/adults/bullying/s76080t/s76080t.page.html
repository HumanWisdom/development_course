            Sometimes bullying happens slowly, so it becomes normalised - like in an abusive relationship, or a boss who treats people badly. Our fear keeps us grounded there - we are so afraid of the unknown that we can put up with bullying, sometimes for years. The damage to our self-esteem and mental health also happens slowly. What if we don't get another job, or find someone else to love us? - our fear can keep us stuck where we are.
          </p>

          <p>
            We have to remind ourselves that there is always the option to leave. It takes courage and we need to face down our fears. It is worth reminding ourselves that life is short, and most good things lie on the other side of fear.
          </p>

          <p>
            We are much more capable and have more reserves than we realise - once you decide to change your life, you will find your fear goes away and you have renewed energy to do what you need to do.
