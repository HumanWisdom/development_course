          Stress feels like a fire in our mind and our first instinct is to escape from it. We all have well established escapes and those patterns repeat themselves. If we are in any danger we may need to physically move away ofcourse. Sometimes our escape patterns can cause more problems long-term. I may escape by drinking alcohol or taking drugs and that may numb my pain, but may lead me into addiction with its own challenges. Or I may overeat leading to obesity, with its own challenges. When I escape the problem is not dealt with so it continues to bother me, and may recurring because the root cause of it has not been addressed.
