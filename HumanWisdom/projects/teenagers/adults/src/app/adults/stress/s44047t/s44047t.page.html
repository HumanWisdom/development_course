          To not be stressed, either I can change the situation, or my reaction to it.
          To change my reaction, I need to understand where it comes from. That opens
          The door to enquiry. I can then explore where my reaction comes from, and what is behind that.
          For example, if a friend does not call on my birthday I can get stressed and angry with him and blame him for how I am feeling. That is an automatic reaction and I can justify my anger. I am sure I am right and he is responsible.If I pause to ask what is behind my reaction, I realise it’s my own unmet expectation that has caused my own pain. Are others responsible for meeting my expectations? Why? Where do they come from? As a result of that understanding my anger towards him dissipates, as does my stress. I still tell him I felt bad he did not call. He apologises and says he got busy and forgot, and that was that. In the process I learn something new about myself, and then realise that the more expectations I have the more likely I am to be disappointed.
