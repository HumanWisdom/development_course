        Let’s explore a simple idea, that has tremendous capacity to bring change- to look at a feeling simply, without language. Language is so embedded into the way we look at the world, and it involves thinking. But we do not need thought or a word to look at a sunrise or a tree, only to name it. You do not need thought or a word to look at a bird flying across the sky. If we can look at a tree without thinking, or language, we can also explore a feeling in the same way, and that can be life-changing.

        New ideas may create resistance, and I urge you to keep an open mind as we explore this. Once you have grasped the beauty of this, you’ll be pleased that you did.
