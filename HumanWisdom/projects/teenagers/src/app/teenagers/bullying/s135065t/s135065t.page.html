            It is not easy for us to look at ourselves honestly - but it is worth asking if our behavior might be considered as bullying by others. Are we acting in ways that others find hurtful? And do we justify that behavior to ourselves? 
            Are we hurting ourselves and do we take it out on others without realizing it?
            Can we find another way of dealing with our own pain?
            Do we feel insecure and want to control others? 
            Or have we been conditioned to think that bullying is normal?
          </p>

          <p>
            We can never heal our own wounds by hurting others. And we can never be at peace with ourselves if we are not at peace with others.
          </p>

          <p>
            Could our actions be kinder, more thoughtful and more empathetic? Could we sow the seeds of love in the world, rather than hurt and pain? We will benefit the most from this ourselves

            This begins in the school playground and continues through life.
            Children pick on and bully anyone who happens to be different - a different skin colour, or too clever, or with ginger coloured hair, or too short, or overweight - and so on.
          </p>

          <p>
            Why do we do that? Itâ€™s a complex mix of reasons. Our mind compares what we see with what we know, and if there is a big difference, that creates a disturbance in our thinking.  We react to that in different ways - one of them being to make fun of the other person, or tease them, not realising it's a form of bullying.

            Adults who are different are treated in a similar way - if they have a disability for example
