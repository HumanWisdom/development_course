            Bad things happen to all of us. How can we move on, so it does not impact our lifethe present in ways that do not serve us?
          </p>

          <p>
            Keep a diary and write down how you feel about being bullied and how it shapes your thinking and your behaviour.

          </p>

          <p>
            Are you more wary of people now, are you quick to react to any perceived criticism, or do you bully others and are not aware you are doing so?
          </p>
          <p>
            Your self-esteem may be affected by being bullied. Realise that it is up to you to value yourself. Donâ€™t give that key to someone else.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once you become aware of the many ways bullying can impact your present and shape your future, you can do something about it.
