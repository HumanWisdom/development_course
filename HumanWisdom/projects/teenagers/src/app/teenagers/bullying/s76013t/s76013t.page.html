            How does bullying impact the people being bullied? There is stress and emotional suffering on a scale that is difficult to estimate. Because it is repeated it also creates an anxiety of it happening again. It robs people of their sense of self-esteem and can lead to self harm and suicidal thoughts.

Some are not so lucky and donâ€™t have the option of leaving and continue to suffer
