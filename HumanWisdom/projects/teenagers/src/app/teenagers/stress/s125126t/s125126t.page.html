            The challenges of life never stop coming and sometimes  we feel we cannot cope: whether it's too much school work, or the pain of loss, or bullying, or loneliness, and so on. Why do some people seem to cope much better than others, and carry on and face the situation and get past it? Perhaps you could ask yourself: Why do I feel that way and what do I need to do next to get past this?
          </p>

            It may involve accepting things as they are or doing something active, but a positive attitude can make all the difference. Other people have endured similar situations and come through, and so will you. The best way to get past the challenges life throws at us is to face them with a positive attitude. I know it's not easy, but the alternative is a chronic feeling of stress.
