          Despite knowing the dangers, what makes an intelligent mind slide into addiction? 
          <br>
          Addiction rates are between 15-40%, if you include the use of the phone. It happens slowly, driven by our environment, our need for pleasure or our need to escape from our stress and emotional pain.Our mind ignores the harm addictions can cause and we convince ourselves we are always in control, when we may not be. While an addiction to smoking, alcohol or drugs may be a way of escaping from stress initially, the harm it can cause is long-lasting. Exploring it allows us to avoid it and respond with intelligence.
