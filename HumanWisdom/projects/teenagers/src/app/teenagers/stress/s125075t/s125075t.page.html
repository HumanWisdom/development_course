          Have you noticed how the patterns of stress keep repeating themselves in our own lives, and in others around us. Since stress is an automatic reaction from our conditioned mind to the events around us, it follows that if the stress is unchanged,  our reactions will not change either. We are not aware of this. For example, if I always get stressed when I am meeting a group of people, I could explore why, and realise its about being afraid of rejection, and that could help me get over it.
