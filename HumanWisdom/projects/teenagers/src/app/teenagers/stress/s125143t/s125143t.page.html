          It's normal to try and fix the problem that is causing our stress. If it's a flat tyre or a toothache it is straight-forward. It is much more difficult to change another person’s opinion, or the way they are doing things, or the state of the world, or what others think of us. It requires wisdom to know what we can change, and what we can’t, but also to know if our attempt to change things may make things worse.
