            Our reactions come from our particular slice of memory, which we call our stress, which is another word for all our past influences. We are not aware of this. If I am in a conservative country and see two men kissing I may get really upset and call the police, because I have been conditioned to regard it as wrong. If on the the other hand I am on the streets of London, I may not have a reaction at all because for me, it is normal.  All our prejudices come from our stress.
