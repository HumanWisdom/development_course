            Here is another exercise. When you are next in a conversation with friends, notice what is happening in all the different layers of your thinking.             
          </p>
          <p>
            In layer one is the other person speaking. In layer 2 is your reaction to what is being said. In layer 3 may be the urge to speak, or a feeling of boredom if the conversation is not interesting, or you judging the other person based on your own conditioning.
          </p>
          <p>
            In layer 4 is the 'I' recording the conversation, and your self-interest looking for what's in this for you.  Do it with passion and see what happens. Remember nothing is right or wrong in your thinking - just a fact that needs to be explored and understood.
          </p>
