            Our mind is constantly comparing what it sees to what it knows - to make sense of the world - this happens automatically and we are not aware of it. This occurs in layer 3, and is common to all human beings.

            It is this process that is responsible for my feeling jealous, not your holiday. I am comparing myself with you, and because I feel less than you, I feel jealous, and that makes me feel hurt and my hurt makes me angry with you. 
          </p>

          <p>
            We usually have no control of the feeling of jealousy, and can't stop it, even if we want to.

            In Layer 4 is the 'I' that is feeling 'jealous’, and thinking of ways to retaliate. We will explore the ‘Nature of the I’ later.

            Please do not accept these ideas without checking them out yourself. It’s easy. Just look within.
