         <p>Perhaps we can begin by noticing that we judge ourselves as good or bad, right or wrong all the time. It's a pattern that repeats itself. Where does it come from?
          We could then pause the judgement process and see ourselves as we are.
          </p>

          <p>It is in accepting ourselves as we are that there is peace and the freedom to then look at and understand what is going on.</p>
       
          <p>Every emotion we feel is the same as in all human beings, and that may also help us look at ourselves without judgement.</p>
