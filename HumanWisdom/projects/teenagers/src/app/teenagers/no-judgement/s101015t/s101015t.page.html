         <p>Here is an exercise you can try.
          </p>

          <p>The next time you are critical of yourself, see if you can catch that moment and pause. Say you look at social media and see a friend's post has many more likes than anything you have posted.
          </p>
       
          <p>Do one of the breathing exercises you learned in the section on nurturing a quiet mind.
          </p>

          <p>Just observe both the feeling of envy, and the thought, which is critical of yourself for not having enough followers.

          </p>

          <p>If you look carefully you may see the process of comparison at work in the background, which is responsible for your feeling of envy. Social media is just a trigger for that feeling.
          </p>

          <p>Now continue exploring the feeling of envy in yourself.
          </p>

          <p>You are the same human being as everyone else - that may make it easier.
          </p>
