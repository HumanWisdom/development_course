            Communication is a critical skill to learn and the best way to begin is to practise it with your friends, teachers and family members.

         </p>
         <p>
            Employers say many young people have not learned how to communicate with care. One manager told me how four young people sitting across a table were messaging each other rather than getting up and talking to each other. 
         </p>

         <p>
            The secret to great communication is curiosity. Take a real interest in people - in what they are thinking, feeling, and saying, or not saying.  You canâ€™t fake this. 

         </p>
         <p>
            Begin with being able to listen well, and not interrupt the person who is speaking. When they finish talking, be curious and ask a question rather than jumping in with your comments.
         </p>
         <p>
            Before speaking, ask yourself how it is going to be received.

         </p>
         <p>
            Try and understand what the other person is feeling, beyond the words being spoken.

         </p>
         <p>
            And always try to be kind - in how you speak and listen. People will always remember your kindness
