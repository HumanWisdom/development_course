          You may be a teenager but your social media history is there for others to see for life, and is a reflection of your character and your values. If you post anything that calls your character into question, that is a red flag for employers.
          <p>
            34% of employers say they check someoneâ€™s social media when considering hiring a person, and if you have posted something vulgar, or racist, that can impact your chances. Employers even check your use of language online.

            You can lose a job if you posted something demeaning years ago, and someone comes across it and shares it again.
          </p>

          <p>
             The best way to guard against this is to be very careful what you post publicly.
