                    <p>
                      It is normal to think about what others are thinking about us - it is the way our mind is wired - but it does not always serve us.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Becoming aware of this process in our own mind, understanding what is going on and how it impacts our life can help us respond in a much better way.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Young people say 80% of their stress can be linked to worrying about what others are thinking about them, and we can be certain our assumptions are right - but they may not be.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      This constant worry about what others think can cause stress and anxiety, make us isolate ourselves from others, struggle to make friends because we think nobody likes us,  and get depressed. Our suffering in this case is caused by our own thinking. Seeing this clearly can help us respond with intelligence.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      If you are distressed by this, the first step is to calm your mind down with a breathing exercise, journaling, or an audio meditation. You can then explore what is going on to make you feel this way. This does not mean we go to the other extreme and not care what others think - but the constant worry can cease.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Our mind is always looking out for threats- its an evolutionary tactic to protect ourselves. It was okay when there were real physical dangers around in the past, but perhaps it does not serve us as much in the present.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      We want to  be liked by others and fit into the group because otherwise we worry we will be excluded and be alone - its a primal response - but one that needs examining.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Most of the time people are too busy thinking about themselves and have no time to think about us anyway. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      We cannot assume what others are thinking and read their minds - if we really want to know we have to ask them.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Just as we do not like everyone we meet, we cannot expect to be liked by everyone either - having a few close friends is more than enough.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      If you are frightened of being alone - try spending some time alone and you will see it can be quite peaceful and there is nothing to worry about - and if you are not at peace with yourself, you need to find out why - and there are many resources in the app to help.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Have the confidence to be yourself, develop some close friendships and when your mind gets into this pattern of worry - realise that this does not serve you and does not matter as much as you think.
                    </p>
