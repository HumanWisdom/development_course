                      Have you ever looked at your social media and found a post of someone doing something you would have liked to do - and instantly felt a pang of envy? Or, if a friend tell you about how well they are doing, you congratulate them but inside you feel an envy rising and wish it was you?
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      You are not alone. This feeling of envy is part of being human and causes us so much heartache. It can also affect our relationships with our friends, siblings, family members and people at work.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Have you ever been curious about what is going on to make you feel this way? And why can’t we control that feeling even if we want to?
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      In the age of social media we now compare ourselves with many more people than we could earlier, so the mental health problems this causes are also multiplied. It can result in anger, low self-esteem, and depression.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Our mind automatically blames others for how we feel. What is going on?
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      To find out we have to be curious and have an open mind. As we look more closely and ask what is going on in our mind to make us react in this way we can see clearly that our mind is comparing all the time - without our awareness, and it is this process that makes us feel envious and less than others. It is nobody’s fault - it's just the way the mind is wired.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      The more we become aware of this unconscious process the more we can be in charge of our own mind and compare ourselves with others only when it serves us. This can bring freedom from heartache and help us feel happier with who we are and what we have.
                    </p>
