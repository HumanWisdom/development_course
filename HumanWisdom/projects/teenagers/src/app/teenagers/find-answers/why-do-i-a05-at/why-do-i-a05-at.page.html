                      Negative self-talk is common, and if you are critical of yourself, you are not alone.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Self-criticism takes many forms. You could be critical of how you speak, or look, or the clothes you have, or how much money you have, or how important you are, or how clever or emotionally intelligent you are. Or you could be a parent and be critical of your parenting skills. Or you may want to lose weight and be critical of yourself for your inability to self-regulate your habits around food and drink. Or you may be criticised by others and believe them - someone may say that you are no good at Maths, or that you are no good at football - and that becomes a story you repeat to yourself over and over again - sometimes for years.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      This is an automatic process and we seem to have no control over it - the negative thoughts just keep coming and we can get exhausted. We tend to believe everything we think is true and our mental health suffers. We may lose confidence in who we are and our ability to do things. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Have you paused and ever asked yourself why that is, and what is going on in your own mind to make you feel this way? This understanding can be enlightening and bring freedom from all these negative thoughts.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      It probably begins with our conditioning - all our influences from our past and present combine to create in our minds an idea of the person we should be. Social media can add to this. We are not aware we have been conditioned and that these ideals of who we should be are not our own ideas - but linked to our conditioning influences. They are not wrong but operate in the background. We compare who we are with who we think we should be and become self-critical. Because there is no one to challenge our opinions about ourself these thoughts continue unchecked and we repeat them to ourselves over and over again until they become our reality.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Freedom from this process lies in understanding what is going on in our own mind and that awareness allows us to be in charge of our own  mind. We can then accept ourselves as the human being that we are - complex and far from perfect. This does not mean we do not strive to improve, but we do so without being critical of ourselves. This can boost our confidence, help us be happier and look after our mental health.
