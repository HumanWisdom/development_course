          We begin with the 3 steps to enquiry - to first notice, then accept that our thoughts come from our own thinking, and then question why we think that way. 
          <br>
          In this example, say I meet you and you have a different opinion about the same political leader. I start arguing with you and the argument gets quite heated. We both try to convince each other we are right and our relationship gets strained. If I pause and ask why I think the way I do and what's behind the argument, it becomes clear that we have both been conditioned differently and are attached to our respective views. Then I can ask in which other way I've been conditioned, and discover so much more. As a result our argument ends. It all begins by taking ownership of what I am thinking and feeling and asking what's going on in my thinking to make me think this way.  Remember conditioning isn't wrong, but questioning it allows us to respond with intelligence
