          Life throws challenges at us regularly. Our mind assumes that how we feel is based on what has happened to us - for example if a teacher has criticised your work.Is it the criticism, or your reaction to the criticism that causes your stress? If it is the criticism, everyone would be equally stressed by criticism. But some donâ€™t get stressed at all. So our stress, or emotional pain, is an automatic reaction from our thinking to what has happened. It is not our fault. Taking ownership of our feelings and not blaming others for how we feel, allows us to explore why we feel that way, and do something to change how we react. This puts us in charge of our own emotions, and can affect how we feel.
