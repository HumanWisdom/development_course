          Acceptance is perhaps the most powerful tool you have at your disposal to put out the fire of emotional pain in your mind. So much of our pain is just the difference between how things are  and how we want them to be. If you can accept yourself as you are, others as they are, and the world as it is, your pain can dissolve. It is not always possible, or easy. You may for example accept that someone you love has left you, and they are always free to do so and your life will move on, or you may accept youâ€™ve failed an exam and can do it again, or you made a mistake and can do better next time. Acceptance does not mean that you do not try and change things that need changing, but you do so with a calm mind.
