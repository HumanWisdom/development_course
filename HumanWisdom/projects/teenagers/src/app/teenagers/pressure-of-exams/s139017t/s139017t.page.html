            Practice this simple breathing exercise for 10 minutes a day. It’s a simple way to reduce your own stress. Place your right hand on your chest. Take a deep breath, filling your lungs, and let it out slowly. Now breathe in slowly to a count of 4 1-2-3-4, filling your lungs, and breathe out slowly to a count of 6 1-2-3-4-5-6. Notice how your chest rises and falls. Notice the air entering and leaving your nose. Continue with this breathing, and get into a gentle rhythm.
           </p>
           <p>
            Now, as you continue with the breathing, notice what is going on in your own mind. Are your thoughts buzzing around, thinking of what you need to do, or what others are thinking, or about some past event? Do you feel restless?  Just observe your thoughts, without trying to change them. Stay with whatever you are feeling, not suppressing it, or giving in to it – but just being with it. Gradually you will notice that your mind quietens.
