            In this example, say, I go to a fast food restaurant.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            I remind myself that I am already overweight and need to be careful what I eat.
          </p>

          <p>
            Once I am there, however, I seem to forget that, lose all self-control, over eat, feel guilty about it, and promise I'll do better next time. But the cycle continues.
          </p>

          <p>
            What's going on?
          </p>

          <p>
            Hidden from my awareness, food is a familiar source of pleasure for me.          </p>

          <p>
            My old patterns of pleasure override the thoughts that get in the way of its fulfillment, particularly when I am feeling a bit uneasy.
