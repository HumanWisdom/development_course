            Indulging in pleasure dulls the mind and we feel weary - for example if you watch video games or movies all day, and these activities soon cease to give us pleasure.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            The same thing happens if you take drugs or drink too much or go shopping all day. 
          </p>

          <p>
            Notice this in yourself and find out if it is true.
          </p>

          <p>
            A dull mind loses its sensitivity to the beauty of the world, and its ability to make rational decisions that are in its best interest.
          </p>
          <p>
            A deeper understanding of the way the mind works leads to a natural sense of peace, and pleasure finds its rightful place in our lives
