            Lets explore envy through this pyramid.. At the very top is the thing that is making us envious or jealous, it could be a friend who has been on a great holiday.
          </p>

          <p>
            The second layer is to notice what we are thinking or feeling and we may notice that we blame the other person for our envy, or may feel guilty.
          </p>

          <p>
            Then our awareness goes deeper and in the third layer, we notice the process of comparison at work in the background. This is not always easy to spot
          </p>

          <p>
            The last layer of awareness is one we are going to explore in a separate module, which is to ask - who feels the pain of envy?
          </p>

          <p>
            Though, for the sake of describing envy I've divided it into 4 sections, you can be aware of all four levels at once. The more you notice, the more you see, and the easier it gets.
