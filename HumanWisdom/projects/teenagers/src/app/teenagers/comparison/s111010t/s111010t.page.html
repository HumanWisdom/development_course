          I was speaking to a group of students in a secondary school and we had been exploring how our mind compares all the time - for example if I come first in a race I feel great. If my friend comes first and I come last, I feel rubbish. Or, I compare the likes I get on my social media vs my friends.  I asked them at the end what they had learned and how it could impact their life. A girl at the back said, â€˜if we could understand the hidden process of comparison in our thinking , and be aware of it  of it, we could be free.
