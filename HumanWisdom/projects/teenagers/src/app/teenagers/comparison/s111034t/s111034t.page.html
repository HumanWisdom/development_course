          If we meet people who are different to us our mind automatically compares what we regard as normal with the person we see. If the person is very different, it can trigger our prejudices â€“ whether based on skin colour or sexual orientation or religion. This happens without our awareness. If I live in a conservative country where gay relationships are banned, I may react with anger when I see a gay couple. My mind compares what I see, with what I know or believe and if there is a difference, it creates a disturbance in my mind - and I react to that.
