            Teachers compare children with each other. Parents compare one child with another, or with their friends. They think this will help children to improve and do this automatically. That is true, but it can also make children feel hurt, think they are no good, lose motivation to try harder, and get angry with their teachers and their parents. When children feel hurt they can get angry and this impacts their behaviour.
