            1 in 3 teenagers suffer from anxiety. The main symptoms are a feeling of dread, racing thoughts, poor sleep and appetite, and  being irritable. It can also cause physical symptoms like a dry mouth, a tightness in the chest, sweating, fast breathing, tiredness, and dizziness. It can be quite traumatic and can lead to depression. Teenagers caught in its grasp struggle to find a way out. Trying not to be anxious does not work. Behind all anxiety is the process of fear. A deeper understanding of it allows us to avoid it and overcome it or manage it more easily
