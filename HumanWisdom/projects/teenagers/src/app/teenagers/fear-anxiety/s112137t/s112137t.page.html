            If my friend does not call as planned, I may think they no longer like me, when in fact their phone may have just run out of juice, or if my headteacher wants to see me I assume that Iâ€™ve done something wrong, or if my parents have an argument I may assume they are going to split up.  This is what our mind does, so its very helpful to ask ourselves this question, and most often we realise that we are thinking of the worst possible scenario.
