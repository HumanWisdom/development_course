            In this session we are going to explore the nature of fear. Fear is a normal part of being human and is there to protect us from harm - but sometimes it becomes irrational and does not serve us. Wherever water is found in the world it has some common properties. Similarly, there are some facts about fear which are the same in all of us so we can explore them together. For example the unfamiliar often creates fear, and we often end up hating those we fear most, which can lead to conflict and war. You can see this in conflict zones around the world. Each side develops a negative narrative about the other which they believe to be true, and this fuels their fear and hatred of the other group. Understanding the roots of fear in our thinking could help reduce the wars in the world
