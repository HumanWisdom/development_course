            We have explored in a separate module how we humans have many emotional needs we are not aware of, and wherever they are met we become attached - whether it is to a person, a pet, an object like a new car, or our status. Wherever there is this emotional attachment, which is not wrong, there is also the fear of its loss. Will we lose our parents, or our pets, or our friends if we change schools, and so on. If I am the best tennis player in the world I become afraid of being beaten and being number 2. This also applies to all performers. This process occurs unconsciously, without our awareness. All we notice is the fear. Just observe and understand. There is nothing more to do
