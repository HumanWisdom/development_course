            Our thinking process often magnifies the fears we do have, and imagines the worst possible outcome. If we are afraid of exams, our fear is we are going to fail, rather than not just do as well. Or if someone does not call as we expected, we imagine they don’t like us anymore, rather than they were just busy, and so on.
