            No matter what we are anxious about, if we can accept that completely, our anxiety can end. For example if we are worried about dying, and not knowing what happens after that, because we accept that it is part of the cycle of life and nothing lives forever, then our fear can end. Or if I am learning to ride the bicycle and accept that I may fall off it, my fear can end. Or, if I fail an exam I know I can sit it again, and that can make my fear go away.This deep acceptance of whatever happens is not easy, but ask yourself the question and see what happens.
