            Here is a simple test you can do to check for yourself
            <br>
            If fear is caused by thinking. The next time you are worried,
            Or anxious just distract yourself and think about something else - 
            Watch a movie, or go for a fast run - while you are thinking about something else,
            Your fear goes away - and returns as soon as you think about the event again
