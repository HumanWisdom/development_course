          Upto 40% of people in relationships feel lonely and say that this is more painful than the pain of being alone. It can occur if there is no feeling of connection with the other person and can occur if you don’t make the time to share what is actually going on with you - your hopes, fears, expectations, and disappointments, and if your communication remains superficial.
