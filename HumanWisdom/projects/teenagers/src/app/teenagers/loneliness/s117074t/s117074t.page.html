            In this session we are going to explore how we respond to loneliness with wisdom. It's not just about being alone, because people in relationships can feel very lonely as well. Perhaps it's about being deeply connected with oneself, and others. To find out what we can do to meet this feeling with wisdom we need to explore it with an open mind. The first thing to do is not run from that feeling. To turn around, breathe deeply and say hello to it - to sit down with it like an old friend and see what we can learn.
