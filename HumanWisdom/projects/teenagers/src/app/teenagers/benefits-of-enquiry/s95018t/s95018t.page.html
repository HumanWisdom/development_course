            Deep down, the human mind functions in similar ways. The nature of fear and pleasure is the same whether you are 5 or 50, though the external events may be different - it could be you are afraid of an exam when you are a student, or a job interview as an adult. Understanding yourself helps you to understand others because our minds function in similar ways,  and as a result all your friendships can improve. You may realise that just as you like to talk about yourself, others do too.
