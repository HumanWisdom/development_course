            Welcome to the art of learning about yourself and how your mind works.In this module, we are going to explore how we can look at and understand ourselves.We know how to look at the world, but not how to look at ourselves or how our minds work.Once we know how to understand ourselves we can set out on our own journey of learning and discover our own wisdom. It is a skill we can all learn and it can be life-changing.
          </p>

          <p>
            It is similar to learning a new language. Understanding ourselves helps us to understand others better because deep down we are the same human being.
