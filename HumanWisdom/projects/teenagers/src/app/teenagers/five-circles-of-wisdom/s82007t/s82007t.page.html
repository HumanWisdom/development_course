            In the art of enquiry,you are going to learn the art of self-awareness. We are going to walk with you and show you how to do this. We know how to look at the world, but not ourselves. Weâ€™ll start by giving you some tips on how to begin. Then talk about the 3 steps to enquiry, explore insight, and introduce you to awareness. For this enquiry to succeed, we have to pause judgement of ourselves and ask questions. We are going to introduce you to the beauty of looking at yourself simply, without language, and also explore the many obstacles you may find on this journey.
