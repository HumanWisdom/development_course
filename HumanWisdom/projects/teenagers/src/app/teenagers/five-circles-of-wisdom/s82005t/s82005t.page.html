            The first circle of wisdom is to nurture a quiet mind and we have 5 different techniques to share with you. A quiet mind allows us to be more sensitive to the thoughts and feelings we have. Try and do at least 1 of these exercises every day so it becomes as regular a part of your day as brushing your teeth. You donâ€™t have to sit in a quiet room for most of them, you can do them anywhere through the day. They are also a great way to deal with acute emotions we all feel like stress, anxiety, and anger.
