            There are many hidden and automatic processes of thinking which are common to all human beings that operate behind the scenes which influence our thoughts and actions. For example, our mind compares itself with others all the time. By understanding them clearly we can begin to deal with life in a completely different way. This understanding also allows us to understand others better. These patterns are not wrong, but a deeper understanding allows us to avoid so many problems and live with wisdom.
