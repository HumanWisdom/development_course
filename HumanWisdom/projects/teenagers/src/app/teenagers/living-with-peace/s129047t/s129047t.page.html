          Of all the things we can do ourselves to live in peace, a radical acceptance of people and situations as they are can perhaps make the biggest difference. This needs to be done actively, and requires a real generosity of spirit. Perhaps zooming out and realising that in the long term most things donâ€™t matter, and even if they do, if we cannot change what has happened, the quicker we can accept things as they are, the quicker we can get on with living fully in the present. This acceptance could apply to  what we look like, our marks in an exam, the number of likes we have on social media, and so on. It is not easy to do, but without it, there is no peace. It is helped by realising that life is only in the moment we are alive right now, and being in it fully, requires us to accept whatever has happened.
