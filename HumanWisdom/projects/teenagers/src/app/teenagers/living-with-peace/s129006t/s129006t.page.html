            Welcome to this module where we are going to explore how we can live in peace, with ourselves, each other and the earth. Our time on earth is limited, and we want to make the most of it. Even a moment spent in conflict is a moment we waste the gift of life that has been given to us. This module is part of the 5th circle of wisdom where we apply the understanding gained from the other 4 circles to live with wisdom. We are going to explore the many reasons why we don’t live in peace, and how we can use our wisdom to do so. If we can live in peace with ourselves, it is easier to live in peace with others, and the earth.
