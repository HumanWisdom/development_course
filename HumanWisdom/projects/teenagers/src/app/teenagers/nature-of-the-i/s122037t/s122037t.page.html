          We have explored how the ‘I’ wants more and more. It looks for every opportunity to strengthen itself. You could call this our ego, but it is much more than that. Our self-interest is rooted in the ‘I’ and this translates into our behaviour in all aspects of our life. We like to speak more than we like to listen, seek to be important and accumulate power if we can. We take all this for granted. It is behind much of the stress we feel if we cannot get what we want, or if we find others are better than us. It is also why we do not live with a sense of peace.
