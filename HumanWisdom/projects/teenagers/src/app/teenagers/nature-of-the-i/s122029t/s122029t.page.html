          It is a universal feature of the ‘I’ that contentment eludes most human beings. We want more and more and are never satisfied. This comes from our deep sense of insecurity and our restlessness. For example, every time we buy something we get a small burst of pleasure and that feeling of restlessness goes away. All pleasure is fleeting though, and when that pleasure fades, the restlessness comes back and we need to buy something again. As possessions accumulate they seem to mean less and less to people. What was new once and brought pleasure, is now overlooked as we pursue the new. If we can find our own sense of peace within, we can discover the joy of contentment for ourselves. In pursuing more and more our mind wears itself out, and encounters many frustrations along the way.
