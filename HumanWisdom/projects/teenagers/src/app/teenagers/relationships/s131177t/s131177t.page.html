            Welcome to this session where we are going to explore perhaps the most important question in this module on relationships. When we feel hurt, how can we respond with intelligence? The answer to this question will determine whether relationships flourish and grow from strength to strength, or if they get into a downward spiral, and break down eventually. Conflict and getting hurt in relationships is very common, but if we can respond with intelligence and wisdom, we can learn about ourselves and others, grow as human beings, and have enduring relationships with depth
