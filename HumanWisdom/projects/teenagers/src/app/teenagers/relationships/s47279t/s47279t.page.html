          Welcome to this session where we will explore the painful subject of breaking up, and how we can approach that with intelligence, particularly where children are involved. With upto 50% of marriages and 70% of cohabiting couples breaking up there is so much anger and anguish on all sides. With some care,and wisdom, much of this can be avoided, and even though it is still painful, it does not have to be as messy as it is in some cases and can be the foundation for new beginnings for everyone involved
