            When we are criticised it is worth reminding ourselves that all criticism is just the difference between the other person’s idea of normal, which comes from their unconscious conditioning, and who we are. So when we are criticized, it tells us a lot about what the other person’s conditioning is and reveals more about who they are, than who we are. This can help us not to take the criticism too personally.
