            It depends on the situation, but if we are being criticized for a mistake we have made, accepting it and saying sorry is something that can defuse the situation straight away and something the other person may not be expecting. It can then allow the discussion to move forwards.
            How easy do you find it to say sorry? Its a real skill to learn to do it sincerely and can help overcome many arguments.
