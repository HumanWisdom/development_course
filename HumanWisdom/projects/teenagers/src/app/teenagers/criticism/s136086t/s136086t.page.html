            We compare ourselves with others all the time, and if we think they are richer, or better looking, or have more friends than us, that can make us feel inadequate, and dislike ourselves. Once you become conscious of this process at work in the background, it naturally ceases, and you can be free - and only compare yourself with others when it serves you.
