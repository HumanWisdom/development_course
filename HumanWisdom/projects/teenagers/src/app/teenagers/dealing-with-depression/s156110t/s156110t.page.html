            While it is so important to acknowledge to ourselves that we have a mental illness and need to do something about, at the other end of that scale is another danger which is to be avoided - identifying so much with our depression that it becomes a part of our identity - and the thought - who or what will I be if I am not depressed?
          </p>

          <p>
            When anything becomes part of our identity we naturally become attached to it - and this happens without our awareness. If we become attached to it, it becomes a friend we don’t want to let go of. There may be some subtle benefits which come our way as well - atleast I am a somebody now - I am depressed. Perhaps we get more attention, or others do more around the house, or we don’t have to take ownership of our behavior. It is easy to feel like a victim of our circumstances. This happens without our awareness and is linked to how our mind functions. You can still take control of your life.

            The danger with feeling like a victim is that you do not feel you can do anything about it, and so you remain stuck where you are. There is sometimes a subtle pleasure in feeling like we have been wronged by others. Only you know if this applies to you and what you are going to do about it - but people sometimes waste their entire lives because of this.
