            There are many occasions in life when we need to have difficult conversations with others and we can all learn to do that well. It's a valuable life skill. Our fear makes us avoid them. The problems don’t go away though, and the anger, pain and misunderstandings can ruin a relationship. If we want to have healthy long term relationships, we need to learn how to have these difficult conversations, so the problems get dealt with quickly. This can also bring people together and improve the intimacy and depth of their relationship.
