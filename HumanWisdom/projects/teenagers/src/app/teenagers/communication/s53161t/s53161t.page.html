          Understanding ourselves is the foundation of wisdom. To do this we could begin with exercises to nurture a quiet mind, because a quiet mind is more able to notice our hidden thoughts and feelings. We could then learn the art of enquiry or how to understand ourselves, and then explore the hidden patterns of thinking that operate behind the scenes influencing our thoughts, feelings and actions. Understanding ourselves helps us to understand others, and all our relationships can benefit.
