          Just as it's important to pause before speaking to allow intelligence to step in and do the right thing, it is perhaps even more important to not let fear stop you from speaking out if there is an injustice being done. Evil thrives when good men are silent. Speaking out has its consequences and needs to be done with intelligence.

All around the world journalists do that every day.
