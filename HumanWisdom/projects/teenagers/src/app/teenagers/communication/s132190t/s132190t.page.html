          Our minds are reactive and sometimes there is no interval between what we hear and our response. You can see this in how you react when your opinion is challenged, or you are criticized, or if someone is doing something differently to how you normally would. You can also see this in an argument, where something the other person says triggers your reaction automatically, and can quickly escalate into conflict. A reactive mind has no space for intelligence to operate. By observing this in ourselves we can begin to do something about it. Nurturing a quiet mind allows us to slow our reactions down so we can consider the different options before responding. If we see our mind is reactive, we know others are the same, and when someone reacts to what we say, we know what is going on, and may just be quiet at that time, and pick it up later.
