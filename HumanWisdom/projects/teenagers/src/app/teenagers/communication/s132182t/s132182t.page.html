           Have you noticed how in a conversation people are so much interested in talking about themselves and telling their stories, rather than in listening to others? Our self-interest operates in the background, and impacts how we communicate. We scan a conversation for something interesting and stop listening if we are not being stimulated. We get pleasure from talking about ourselves, so steer the conversation to do that. We have a subtle need for importance so may try to show we are better than others in some way. Or we may approach a person thinking ‘What's in it for me’?
          </p>
          <p>
           This is not right or wrong, but just how the human mind functions. This can help us understand others better, and allow us to put our self-interest to one side to build connections with others.
