            There are many occasions in life when we need to have difficult conversations with our friends or with our parents and we can all learn to do that well. It's a valuable life skill. It maybe you need to tell your friends you don’t want to drink alcohol or do drugs, or tell someone you are dating you no longer want to be with them. It may also mean talking to your parents about how you really feel about something.  Or you may need to tell the teacher you are being bullied at school. Our fear makes us avoid them. The problems don’t go away though, and the anger, pain and misunderstandings can ruin a relationship. If we want to have healthy long term relationships, we need to learn how to have these difficult conversations, so the problems get dealt with quickly. This can also bring people together and improve the intimacy and depth of their relationship.
