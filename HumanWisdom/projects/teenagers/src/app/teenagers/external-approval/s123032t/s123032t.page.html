          Like the doctor in the story, we blame others for our suffering when we are not praised or recognised. This is just the way our mind works. It could be a parent who does not praise us for our achievements, or our friends who do not say nice things about us on social media
          When we blame others for our suffering, our mind thinks of retaliating in some way. It could be by withdrawing our affection from our friends, or becoming more indifferent at work, or our anger can express itself more directly.  We do not see that our suffering begins with our own expectations.
