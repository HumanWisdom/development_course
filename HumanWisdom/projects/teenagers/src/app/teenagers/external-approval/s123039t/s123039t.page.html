          If I am a performer – a musician, an actor or a public speaker, and my sense of self-worth is determined by the applause or praise I get, then every time I perform I experience severe anxiety because I am worried about what others will think. It seems so hard-wired into my system that I cannot control it or do anything about it. 
Performance anxiety is common among musicians and actors, but also affects people in other professions. It can also affect students who are sitting exams in a similar way. 
This feeling of anxiety is heightened if we have experienced this praise before. Many performers take drugs to calm themselves down.
