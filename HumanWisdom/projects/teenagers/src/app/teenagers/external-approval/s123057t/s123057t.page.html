          The first step is always the most difficult – which is to explore the fact without judgement. What’s wrong with trying to be famous you ask? Nothing.
          Our mind is always judging what it sees as good or bad, right or wrong. If you regard the need to be important and famous as a great thing, you will resist exploring this further. If you regard it as a bad thing you will try and do the opposite and practice humility – neither of which deepen your understanding of what is going on in our thinking.
          Your mind functions in the same way as everyone else – so you are not alone. Begin with an open mind that is curious and open to learning about itself. So many amazing discoveries await/
