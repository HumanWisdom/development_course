            We are drawn to meditation for different reasons. We may want to be 
            healthier, more calm, less stressed or anxious, and so on. Whichever type of meditation
            practise we choose, it is also important to understand our various thoughts and feelings and ourselves. Without a deeper understanding of ourselves, meditation is limited in its benefit.
