            Any strong emotion, like stress, anxiety or anger can cloud our judgment and influence our decision making.
          </p>

          <p>
            When our emotions are running high, like when we're angry, we can make decisions without considering all the options - a sort of knee jerk reaction.
          </p>

          <p>
            If we are anxious, we may not go to school sometimes, or not go out to meet friends.
          </p>

          <p>
            It is common sense to postpone any decisions to when we are feeling more calm.
