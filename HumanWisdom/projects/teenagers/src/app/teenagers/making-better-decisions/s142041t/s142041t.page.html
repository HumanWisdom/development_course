            Another way to make a decision when you are not sure what to do, is to do a risk analysis.
          </p>

          <p>
            What are risks involved with doing something, versus the risks involved with not. Is the potential downside considerable, and worth it? Or, are you better off taking the less risky option? Our mind generally tends to underestimate the risk, especially when fun is involved.
          </p>

          <p>
            For example, at a party you may be offered some drugs, and you may be tempted to take some. And you tell yourself - Why not? But if you pause to do a risk analysis, which is not always easy, you may realise you can die from taking ecstasy - many people have, and decide not to.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            The same applies to doing some swimming in a lake on a hot day - many young people drown each year from not realizing how strong the currents can be, or overestimating their abilities.
          </p>

          <p>
            Or you could be sitting an important exam and be tempted to cheat, thinking the risk is minimal, but if you get caught you could be thrown out of the school - so is it worth it?
          </p>

          <p>
            As you grow older, this often helps you make better decisions.
