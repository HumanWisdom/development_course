            We often make decisions on incomplete information and that makes for bad decisions.
            It is worth pausing to ask if you have all the facts to hand before deciding. 
          </p>

          <p>
            For example, when choosing which subject to study in senior school, you may assume that its going to be harder work than it is, or assume you are not capable - and both of those assumptions may not be correct. 
          </p>

            Or you may assume that taking drugs is harmless and everyone does that - and that may damage your health.
          </p>

          <p>
            We also make assumptions about people - for example we may assume someone does not like us, and be mean to them - but that may not be the case.
          </p>

          <p>
            Or, when you get upset with someone because they were supposed to call you and didnâ€™t, it is worth finding out why beforehand - they may have met with an unforeseen problem
