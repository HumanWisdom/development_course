            As you go through you can record your reflections in your own journal. Writing taps into different parts of our brain and is a great way to explore  these questions.

            At the end of each module we will offer you a certificate of completion which you can share with others. As you go through the program, you will accumulate wisdom points which you can exchange for some of our features.
