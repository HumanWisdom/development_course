            This is the simplest thing you can do to be happier just now. Look around your life and make a list of what you have to be grateful for and add to it regularly. My list is long and includes sunshine, grilled tomatoes, the poetry of Mary Oliver, the songs of Eva Cassidy, people I love and who love me, and running! You have to do this consciously. The mind focuses on the new, and the future, so it won't do it for you. Being grateful connects you to the present, which is the only moment you are alive
