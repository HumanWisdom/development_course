          In this section we take everything we have learned from the previous 4 sections and apply it to enhance every aspect of our life. Any problems we face that begin in our thinking can be prevented and more easily dealt with with this deeper self-understanding to it. There are modules to explore here covering every aspect of life from stress and bullying, to love, relationships and happiness, from communication and leadership to self-esteem and criticism. You can avoid addiction and overcome it more easily because it's linked to the unconscious drivers in your own thinking. You can have a healthier relationship with food, deal with sorrow and bereavement, and make better decisions in your life. Remember to explore with curiosity, without judgement and with an open mind. Transformation occurs when you actually look at and learn about yourself and apply what you are learning to your life. Our life on earth is limited - living with this inner intelligence or wisdom can help you make the most of it.
