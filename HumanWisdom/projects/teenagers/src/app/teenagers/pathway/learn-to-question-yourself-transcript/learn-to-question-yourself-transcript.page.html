          We know how to look at the world but not ourselves. The astronomer has a telescope to look at the stars but we only have our own intelligence to look within - so this section explores the art of looking and learning about ourselves - which is one of the greatest skills to learn, because it can help you be a scientist and begin your own journey of discovery to find out for yourself who you are and how your mind works. No matter what happens in your life, you will be able to make sense of it, and self-correct to feel stable again. Inside all of us is a treasure waiting to be discovered, and these are not just empty words. The modules in this section will give you the skills to begin exploring your own mind, and discover that sense of peace and compassion for yourself. Remember to be curious, and travel with an open mind, not judging what you observe as right or wrong.
