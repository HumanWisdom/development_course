          The modules in this section are designed to help you develop a calm mind. We help you connect with nature in a fresh way - noticing what you see more carefully, and soaking it in - this can help reduce stress and calm the mind. There are a number of breathing exercises which if done regularly help create that pause between a  trigger and a reaction, allowing your intelligence a chance to step in and operate. You can do them anywhere, and about 10 minutes a day is great if you can manage it.  The noticing thoughts exercise uses the online journal to get all your thoughts out of your head so you can examine them. There is a module on meditation which goes into the subject in detail with practical tips on how to get started. Finally there are guided audio meditations for you to enjoy. Connecting with the deeper silence within you can be nourishing and help you deal with the challenges of life.
