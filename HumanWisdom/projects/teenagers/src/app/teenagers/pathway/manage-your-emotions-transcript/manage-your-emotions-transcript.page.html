          Now you have learned how to have a calm mind, the art of looking and learning about yourself, and how your unconscious mind works, you are ready to apply this to understand and manage your emotions. Our emotions arise automatically from our thinking and we seem to have little control over them. This understanding puts us in charge of how we react and can reduce our suffering from bereavement, loneliness, depression, anger and anxiety. We can become emotionally intelligent and this can contribute to our success - in our personal lives and in the world. It is estimated that 80% of our success is down to our emotional intelligence and only 20% to our IQ. Remember to approach this with curiosity, without judgement, and with a mind open to learning. Transformation only occurs when you apply this understanding to your own life.
