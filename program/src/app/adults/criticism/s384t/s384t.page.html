            If I am an actor and you criticize my acting skills I will feel hurt and blame you for upsetting me. If you tell me Iâ€™m a terrible cook, I will just laugh and agree with you. Why is that? Hidden from my awareness, in layer 3, are my images of myself. I have an image of myself as a good actor, but not as a good cook. Our many unconscious images of ourselves play a big role in the hurt we feel when criticized. We discuss this more fully in a separate module on self-image
