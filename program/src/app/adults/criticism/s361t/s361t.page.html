            We have explored how hurtful criticism can be and how it can invite an angry backlash. So its worth asking yourself a few questions before you criticize another:
          </p>
          <p>
            1. Is this for my benefit or for the other person's benefit?
          </p>
          <p>
            2. How is it going to be received?
          </p>
          <p>
            3. Is this the best time to say it?
          </p>
          <p>
            4. What would happen if I said nothing?
          </p>
          <p>
            5. Can I find something to praise instead? Much more effective at bringing change.
          </p>
          <p>
            6. Am I angry and irritated? Might it be better said once Iâ€™ve calmed down?
          </p>            
          <p>
            These questions also ensure the criticism offered is well thought through and not automatic, which sometimes does more harm than good.
