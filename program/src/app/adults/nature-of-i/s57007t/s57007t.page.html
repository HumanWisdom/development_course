          From the day we are born we are given a name. We grow up being told we are unique.
           We look different to everyone else so it is easy for us to believe that. 
           Through our education we are praised or criticised and told we need to be the best.
            As our memories build up we identify with them as ours. The sense of I gets reinforced through 
            all our activities and our mind pushes us to be unique and special. This happens unconsciously
            and automatically, and is not right or wrong. 
            The ‘I’ is perhaps just an identification with our memory. When we lose our memory,
            say through dementia, this sense of ‘I’ also goes with it.
