          We have explored how the ‘I’ wants more and more. It looks for every opportunity to strengthen
           itself. You could call this our ego, but it is much more than that. Our self-interest is rooted 
           in the ‘I’ and this translates into our behaviour in all aspects of our life. We like to speak
            more than we like to listen, seek to be important and accumulate power if we can. 
            We take all this for granted. It is behind much of the stress we feel if we cannot get what we
             want, or if we find others are better than us. It is also why we do not live with a sense of
              peace.
