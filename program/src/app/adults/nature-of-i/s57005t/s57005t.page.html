          Let’s have a look at this pyramid which represents the different layers of our thinking.
           At the top in layer 1 is what is happening in the world outside - say you see a new phone advertised.
            In layer 2, which is what we can think and feel,  is the thought which says - I want that.
             In layer 3 is our need for pleasure, which we do not realise. Deeper still in layer 4 is 
             the ‘I’ which is restless, empty and wants more and more. All we are aware of is the thought 
             which says ‘I want that phone’. We are not aware of the nature of the ‘I’ operating in the depths
              of our thinking. 
          Now you are aware of it, you can see it at work
