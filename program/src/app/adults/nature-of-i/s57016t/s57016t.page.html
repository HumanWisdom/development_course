          The emotional pain we feel when the ‘I’ is hurt is often more than if we have a physical pain.
           Emotional pain is not as easy to get rid of, and we keep going over it in our thinking. 
           Everytime we do this it gets stronger.
          We also become afraid of being hurt, if we have been hurt before. This may explain why we
           are sensitive to criticism, or afraid of getting too close to people, or get possessive about 
           things we value, or get anxious about people leaving us, or about failure.
            In protecting ourselves from being hurt we may behave in ways that are not in our best interest, 
            ot kind to others. This fear is often unconscious, and shapes our lives in subtle ways
