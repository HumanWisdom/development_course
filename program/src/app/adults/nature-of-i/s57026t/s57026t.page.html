          We have explored that just as the physical body has a need for food and water, 
          so the psychological body or the ‘I’ also has many emotional needs we expect others to meet.
           We have a need to be loved, listened to, to be understood. We have a need for pleasure, for 
           stimulation, for security, to be important and even for power. Wherever these needs are met 
           we get attached -  be it people,, situations or  ideas and even habits and pets. We then
            suffer if we lose anything we are attached to, or feel anxious about the idea of losing it,
             because we are worried about our needs being met…. Where do these needs come from? They are
              common to all of  us human beings. Perhaps they are a response 
          to the deep inner restlessness and emptiness of the ‘I’. When our needs are met, for a short time, this feeling seems to go away or is hidden from our immediate awareness , and we feel reassured and happy.
