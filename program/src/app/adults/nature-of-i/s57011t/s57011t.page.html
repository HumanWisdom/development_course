          Though intimately linked, for the purpose of understanding it clearly we could explore the ‘I’ as a separate psychological body. The physical body needs food and water to survive. The psychological body, the ‘I’,  needs love, attention, pleasure and stimulation to feel good. If we cut our finger with a knife we feel a pain in the finger. If we are criticized for example, we also feel pain. If we are afraid, it seems like our entire body feels the fear. If the ‘I’ suffers, with stress for example, the body gets affected and vice versa. To study the ‘I’ it may be helpful to regard it as a separate entity - that has some common features, which are the same in all human beings
