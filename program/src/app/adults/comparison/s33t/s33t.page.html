          If we meet people who are different to us and our idea of what ‘normal’ is, it can trigger our prejudices – whether based on skin colour or sexual orientation or religion. This happens without our awareness. If I live in a conservative country where gay relationships are banned, I may react with anger when I see a gay couple. My mind compares what I see, with my conditioning which is unconscious and because there is such a difference, it creates a disturbance which expresses itself as a prejudice.
