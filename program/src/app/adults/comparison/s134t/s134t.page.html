            In this last step we are going to ask a simple question. Is there a different way to see the same situation and a different way to respond? There almost always is. Your initial response may still be the correct one, but it’s worth exploring other perspectives first. For example my first reaction may be jealousy and anger, but on exploring other ways of seeing the same situation, I may realise it is not your fault.
