            We have explored the 3 steps to enquiry before, and are now going to apply it to explore envy.
          </p>

          <p>
            Noticing I am envious is the first step.
          </p>

          <p>
            The second step is to accept that feeling as arising in me and taking ownership of it.
          </p>

          <p>
            I am not going to be critical of myself for feeling it, or the other person for causing it. I'm going to suspend judgment and just observe it.
          </p>

          <p>
            The next step is the key - and opens the door to wisdom - and that is asking why do I feel this way? What is behind this feeling of envy? Why do I think the other person is responsible for how I feel? How can I respond with intelligence? That leads me deeper to explore layers 3 and 4 as we did in the previous pyramid diagram.
