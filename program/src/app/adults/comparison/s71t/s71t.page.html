            Our relationships can be affected by comparison in a number of ways.
          </p>

          <p>
            I may compare you to my ideal of who I want my partner to be and try and change you, or you try and change me, and that results in conflict.
          </p>

          <p>
            Or, I compare you with someone who is better than you in some way, and that makes me feel dissatisfied. 
          </p>

          <p>
            I may be constantly critical of you if you are thinking or acting in a way that is different to what I regard as normal. What I regard as normal of course comes from my unconscious conditioning.
