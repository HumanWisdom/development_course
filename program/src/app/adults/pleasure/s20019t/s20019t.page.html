            We have already explored some of them. We know pleasure is fleeting, no matter how intense the feeling.
          </p>

          <p>
            The dopamine released in the brain eventually gets absorbed and the pleasure ends. When it ends we know it leaves us feeling a void, or an inner boredom. It was probably there all along, but the pleasure just covers it up. 
          </p>

          <p>
            That inner boredom then demands to be fulfilled, and this time we need a bigger and better pleasure to chase after. The old one won't do. If we canâ€™t find something suitable we can get frustrated, and some people take to drugs to experience the same feeling again.      
          </p>

          <p>
            All this happens in the background, without our awareness.
