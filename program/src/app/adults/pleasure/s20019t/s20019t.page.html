            We have already explored some of them. We know pleasure is fleeting, no matter how intense the feeling.
          </p>

          <p>
            The dopamine released in the brain eventually gets absorbed and the pleasure ends. When it ends we know it leaves us feeling a void, or an inner boredom. It was probably there all along, but the pleasure just covers it up. 
          </p>

          <p>
            That inner boredom then demands to be fulfilled, and this time we need a bigger and better pleasure to chase after. The old one won't do. If we can’t find something suitable we can get frustrated, and some people take to drugs to experience the same feeling again.      
          </p>

          <p>
            All this happens in the background, without our awareness.
