            Many of our desires lie buried in our subconscious and we are not aware of them, but they drive our thoughts and actions.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            This could be the need for money, or power, or sex, or to be important. If we look carefully we can become aware of them.
          </p>

          <p>
            On the surface we may even convince ourselves that we are not interested in being important, for example, because that makes us look and feel good about ourselves, but the desires continue influencing our lives nevertheless. Becoming aware of them allows us to make conscious choices and live with wisdom.
