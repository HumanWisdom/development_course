            As soon as we want something in the future, a desire is born. We think when we get what we want we will feel better than we do right now. The anticipation of it creates an excitement and a burst of pleasure. That pleasure is born along with the desire.
          </p>

          <p>
            Desire gives us the energy to chase whatever it is we want - whether it is a new job, or more money, or a person, or buying something, or going on holiday. It’s behind falling in love, and common to all human beings. It is intimately linked with pleasure. It’s a beautiful thing, but can also cause many problems, so understanding it allows us to respond in an intelligent way.
