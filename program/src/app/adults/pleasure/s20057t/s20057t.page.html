            Let’s look at an example, say, I am passing a shoe shop. That's what’s happening in the world outside - or layer 1.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            I look inside and feel an urge to go in.
          </p>

          <p>
            I think I really need another pair of shoes, and go in and buy one.
          </p>

          <p>
            I ignore the thought that says I already have more than I can wear. This is what's going on in my thinking or layer 2. This is all I am aware of.
          </p>

          <p>
            If I explore why I did that, I realise that I was feeling a bit restless, and uneasy, and the thought of buying a shoe brought a burst of pleasure I could not resist.
          </p>

          <p>
            Buying shoes is a recurring source of pleasure for me. I wear the shoes twice, and they join the others in my cupboard. All this goes on in layer 3 or the unconscious patterns of thinking that govern my behaviour.
