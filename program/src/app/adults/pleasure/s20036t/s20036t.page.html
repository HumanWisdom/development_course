            The mind constantly and unconsciously seeks pleasure from all its activities and relationships are a major source of it. This can be a beautiful feeling, when two people fall in love, for example.

          <p>
            This feeling of being in love has moved poets and songwriters for centuries and is as old as the hills.

            Understanding the nature of pleasure can however prepare us to avoid the many problems this can also present.

            We know pleasure is fleeting in nature. When two people first fall in love they say 'I love you and really mean it. In a few weeks or months the pleasure begins to fade and the old inner boredom and emptiness returns. We then blame the relationships for how we are feeling and think we need a new relationship to feel that old thrill again.

            This is inevitable. How are we going to respond when that happens?
