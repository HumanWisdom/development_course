            How can understanding pleasure lead to a sense of peace?
            Let’s do this step-by-step. Take your time. This is so important. Lets follows this pyramid which represents the different layers of our thinking.
            In layer 1 you see a new phone advertised and immediately think you need a new one. Notice the subtle pleasure and excitement you feel, in layer 2, and the strong urge to go after what you want, so you buy it.
            Now ask yourself where this desire comes from? What gave rise to this idea to buy a new phone? You already have one that works perfectly well.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            You think by getting the new phone we will be  happy, and that will last a long time or even forever. Behind all desire is the same driver.
            Now ask yourself why you don't feel happy or fulfilled right now - you will notice that ini layer 3, where the need for pleasure operates.
            Look carefully. Do you notice the feeling of emptiness or loneliness or boredom behind that in layer 4 ? It’s a really subtle feeling, and not easy to spot.
            If you do find it, say hello to that feeling, and sit with it quietly not moving from it.
            If you just stay with it and meet it without language, it changes from an ache, to a feeling of peace - thats layer 5. You have discovered that inner source of nourishment for yourself and you then don’t need as much stimulation from the outside.
          </p>

          <p>
            It is simple, but not easy. Take the journey inwards and find out for yourself.
