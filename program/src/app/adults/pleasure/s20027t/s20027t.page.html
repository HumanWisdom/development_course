            Pleasure and pain can be two sides of the same coin, but we are not immediately aware of that. There are 3 ways this can happen.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            If we are chasing something we want and can't get it, like a job, or a new car, we can get frustrated. If we do get it, the pleasure soon fades, and we can find ourselves feeling frustrated again. Or if we become attached to something that is a source of long-term pleasure, like a pet, and it dies, we can experience the sorrow of loss. These are all part of being human and not right or wrong. This understanding can help us live with wisdom
