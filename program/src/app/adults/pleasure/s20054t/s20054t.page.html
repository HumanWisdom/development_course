          The developed world consumes far more, per person, than the developing world, which is trying to catch up. The question no one asks is - why do we consume so much? Perhaps the human need for pleasure has a major part to play. This pleasure can come from buying things and having experiences like holidays, all of which contribute to global warming. I once met a teacher who had 176 pairs of shoes, and had no insight into the process behind it. We know this pleasure is short lived and when it ends it leaves a void which demands to be filled, by more of the same, and that is how we accumulate things which we soon don't even notice, but the cycle continues.
