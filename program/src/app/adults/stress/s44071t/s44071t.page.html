          Have you noticed how the patterns of stress keep repeating themselves in our own lives, and in others around us. Since stress is an automatic reaction from our conditioned mind to the events around us, it follows that if the conditioning is unchanged, so will our reaction. We are not aware of this. For example, if I always get stressed when I am going on a plane, I could explore why, and realise its about losing control, and that could help me get over it.
