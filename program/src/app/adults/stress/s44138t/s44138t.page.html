          It's normal to try and fix the problem that is causing our stress. If it's a flat tyre or a toothache it is straight-forward. It is much more difficult to change another person’s opinion, or the way they are doing things, or the state of the world, or if we have lost a job. It requires wisdom to know what we can change, and what we can’t, but also to know if our attempt to change things may make things worse.
