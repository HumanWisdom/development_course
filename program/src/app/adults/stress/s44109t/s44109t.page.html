          A short burst of anger usually doesn't cause long term stress, but can impact our relationships. <br>But if we carry our anger with us for a long time, perhaps due to a hurt that we cannot forget, that can cause stress. If we can learn to forgive and forget, it is a gift we can give ourselves, for preserving our own long term health. Behind much of our anger is a feeling of being disappointed or hurt, or a feeling of injustice. This is an automatic reaction and understanding the roots of anger in our thinking allows us to respond in the most appropriate way.
