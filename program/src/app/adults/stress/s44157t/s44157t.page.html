          As we have explored there are many causes of stress which emerge from our own thinking and if we can understand them we can avoid them. The key is to have a mind that is sensitive, curious and open to learning. As your understanding deepens much of the stress these hidden patterns of thinking cause, drops away naturally. For example, Once I realise that my mind is comparing all the time and that is behind the ache of envy I feel, then I can respond with intelligence and my mind just stops doing that. Or if I notice its my own images of myself that are behind the pain of criticism, I can examine them and let them go.
