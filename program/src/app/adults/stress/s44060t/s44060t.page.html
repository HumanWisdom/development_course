          We are not always aware we are stressed. Stress presents in so many subtle ways. We could have pain in our tummy, or a headache, or high blood pressure, or not be sleeping well, or start eating and drinking in excess, or become more agitated. It doesn't always present with mental health problems, and even they can creep up on us so gradually, that we may not realise we are stressed. This is why it's important to ask ourselves if we may be stressed, because if we are, we can do something about it, and the earlier the better. 
          Some stress is of course needed and healthy but long term moderate to severe stress can damage our health, so it's important to sort it out as soon as we can
