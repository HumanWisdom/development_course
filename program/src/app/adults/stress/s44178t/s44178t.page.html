            The lack of money is one of the biggest causes of stress for many people and arguments about it cause much disharmony. What can we do about this?
          </p>
          <p>
            One option is to live simply, no matter what our financial circumstances. If you look around your home you will find many things which once brought pleasure, but which you no longer notice. There are many joys which do not require money - walking in the woods, or being with friends and so on. Our need to spend money we do not have on things we think we need but could manage without comes from our conditioning, comparing ourselves with others, and our need for stimulation. Self-understanding leads to a sense of peace, and that allows us to live simply and with contentment.
