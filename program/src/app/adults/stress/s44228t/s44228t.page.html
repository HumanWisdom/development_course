          If we are not aware of it and do nothing, our stress and emotional pain unconsciously conditions us and shapes our future in a number of ways. If we have been hurt in a relationship we may not let anyone else near us again, or if people from one community have hurt us we will carry a lifelong distrust of that community, or leave a profession, like teaching, from the anxiety of being criticised. For many people a single traumatic event can cast a shadow over their happiness for the rest of their lives. A few simple questions can help us respond with intelligence: How is my stress conditioning me, am I going to allow it, and is it good for me in the long run?
