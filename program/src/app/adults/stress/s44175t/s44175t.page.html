          At the core of being human is this feeling  we are often not aware of. We call it different names like inner boredom, restlessness, a void or an emptiness. It is there when we feel lonely, it is behind the feeling of desire and pleasure, and also there when a great pleasure ends. Its also there when you sit quietly for half an hour doing nothing. It is not right or wrong and part of being human. Just observe it in yourself. If you can make your peace with it, but just being with it, and not escaping from it, it transforms into a feeling of peace, and so much of the stress it causes can melt away.
