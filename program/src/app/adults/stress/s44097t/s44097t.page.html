          Worry and anxiety are significant causes of stress, and upto 18% of people in the US report feeling anxious. The mind that is prone to worry finds no shortage of things to worry about. We worry about money, our children, our jobs, of dying or falling ill, what others think of us, of being lonely, and so on. We can get anxious about getting anxious.  We think the cause of our worry is out there, and since it is in the future and not yet happened we cannot solve the problem, so it continues to bother us. We seem to have little control over it. Exploring the nature of fear for ourselves and having an insight that it is generated by our thinking and our conditioning offers the possibility of responding with intelligence. A deep acceptance of uncertainty and whatever the future brings can help reduce anxiety.
