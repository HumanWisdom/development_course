          Healthy relationships require nurturing and investment of time, energy and goodwill, but the long term benefits are enormous. We could all do more. They provide a shelter from the many storms of life, and contribute to our long-term happiness. If we ignore them and take them for granted, they can result in conflict and stress. When we are stressed, having a friend to talk to can make all the difference and without people we feel close to, we can feel lonely, which can also add to our stress.
