          Just as we wake up and brush our teeth every morning so we have healthy teeth all our lives, there are many things we can do to avoid stress. The benefits are obvious. We can avoid the many mental health problems stress can cause and be happier, which is what we all want for our lives. We also want to live a physically healthy and long life and avoiding long term stress is one way of doing that. We just need to realise the importance of doing so, and weave these habits into our daily life. Making a start is the most important - just begin, and do what you can.
