          Stress makes us zoom into a problem and lose perspective. It's like a pin in the finger. All we can think of is the pain in the finger. So if I fail an exam I feel 100% of my life is a failure. Or, if someone I love leaves me, I feel I will never recover, or if I lose my job, that I will never find a job again. This zooming in and losing perspective can have tragic consequences too. So many people take their own lives after a sudden traumatic event, as I mentioned in the first session.
         <br> We will use this understanding later to help us address stress in more intelligent ways.
