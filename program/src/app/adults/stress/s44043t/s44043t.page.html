          Our reactions come from our particular slice of memory, which we call our conditioning, which is another word for all our past influences. We are not aware of this. If I am in a conservative country in the middle-east and see two men kissing I will get really upset and may call the police, because I have been conditioned to regard it as wrong. If on the the other hand I am on the streets of London, I may not have a reaction at all because for me, it is normal.
          <br>Or, if you have a different political opinion to mine, i will react with stress and anger, and not realise that my opinion comes from my conditioning, and the culture I grew up in
