          Everyone responds differently to the same stressful situation. How we respond depends on how stressed we are feeling at the time and does not depend as much on the triggering event. If you have had a tough time at the office and lost your job and are already upset, a small accident can tip you over the edge - that's seen commonly as road rage. Or in inner cities where the smallest argument between people can result in violence. This helps us to understand the behaviour of others whose reaction may feel much more than the triggering event. It may also stop us over-reacting to a stressful event.
