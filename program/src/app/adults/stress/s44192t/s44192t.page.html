          Of all the things we talk about in this section, this one is most important, and may save your life one day. Stress makes us zoom in and lose perspective. Just as you practise a fire drill so you can do it without thinking, similarly when the stress arrives, you react by zooming out. You have to train yourself to do this with small stressful events. Zooming out means realising that in the course of a life this event is not significant and there are still many things you can be grateful for, and just to pause and consider them. You can also realise that many many people have endured events like this and gotten through them and so will you.
