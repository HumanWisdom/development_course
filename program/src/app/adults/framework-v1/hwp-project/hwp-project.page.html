These include mental health problems, conflicts in our relationships, addiction, violence, war, and climate change. To address them we have to go deeper to explore where they begin, and understand ourselves. Living with wisdom allows us to prevent and more easily overcome these problems, and live in peace, with ourselves, each other and the earth.
