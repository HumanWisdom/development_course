          Many of our fears are hidden from our awareness, particularly around money.<br>
          We may have a deep seated fear of not having enough in the future, or not having enough to pay the bills this month. The first step is to write them all down and expose them to the fresh air.
          <br> Then examine them one by one. Are they rational? Or are you imagining the worst possible scenario? Is there something practical you could do, other than worrying? How do these fears shape your thinking and behaviour? Is that something you are happy with?  Or are they making you work too hard, leaving no time for other, more important things, like your health, or your relationships? Or, do your fears stop you spending the money you already have?
