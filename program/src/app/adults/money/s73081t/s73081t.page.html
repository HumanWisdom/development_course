          The first step is to question your conditioning around money.  Begin by writing down all your assumptions about money. How important is it?  How much of your idea of success is linked to it? What are the other things besides money that are equally if not more important? What are your values?  Then explore the origin of these assumptions. They may have come from your family, or the culture you grew up in. They are not right or wrong, but at present they operate unconsciously in the background. Becoming aware of them allows you to examine and question them and decide for yourself what is right for you.
