          Corruption exists the world over, because human beings are the same everywhere. People in positions of authority sometimes cannot resist the temptation of using their position to make more money, especially if they think they can get away with it. There may be a culture of corruption around them, and they may feel they have to follow the crowd. Behind this are the same factors that operate in us all:  Conditioning, insecurity, greed, the need for pleasure and power, and the human mind wanting more and more and never being satisfied. The official who already has stolen millions, wants even more, so surely it canâ€™t be just about the money. So many laws have been created to try and stamp this out, but it continues nevertheless because the people who have to enforce the laws are also caught in corruption. What can be done? 
          <br>Perhaps the change needs to come from the inside, as we will explore in the next session.
