          Beyond our basic needs, much of our need for more money comes from the pleasures and experiences it can buy.
          <br>We think that the  more money we have, the happier we will feel. How long does the pleasure from a new experience or possession last? When it ends what do you feel? Do you feel the need to repeat the experience or buy something new? Has that become a habit for you? Many of our desires are hidden from our awareness and direct our lives. The more you observe your desires in action, the more you will realise that the emptiness that we want our pleasures and desires to fill never really goes away - it just gets covered over. This lack of peace within us needs a different solution.
