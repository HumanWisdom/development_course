          No matter how much money we have, most of us want more. What are we never satisfied?<br> Perhaps we donâ€™t pause to question our conditioning which just said we should accumulate more and more. Or acquiring more money brings us pleasure, or power or keeps us occupied.
         <br> Our urge to acquire more can also make us greedy and stop thinking clearly. As a result we could make irrational financial decisions in the stock market, or fall victim to a scam which promised to make us rich. 
          <br>It can also be a driver for corruption. 
          <br>If making more money becomes the central driver in our life, all our decisions are influenced by it.
