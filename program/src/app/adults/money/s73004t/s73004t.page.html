          Welcome to this module where we explore our relationship with money. Itâ€™s part of the 5th circle of wisdom, where we apply our understanding of how the mind works to live with wisdom.
          It plays a huge role in all our lives. At one end of the spectrum 1 in 10 people in the world live on less than $1.90 per day, and 5 out of 10 on less than $5.50 per day. At the other end, the richest 1% own 43.4% of the world's wealth. No matter how rich or poor you may be, everyone wants more. The fear of not having enough affects many of us, and it can lead to envy, sour relationships and bring out the best, and worst, in people. We are going to explore how our hidden patterns of thinking affect our relationship with money, and how a deeper understanding of ourselves can allow us to respond with wisdom. I invite you to explore this module with a spirit of learning. Nothing we are exploring is right or wrong. It just needs to be understood.
