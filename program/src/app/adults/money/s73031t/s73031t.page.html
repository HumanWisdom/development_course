          I asked some children in a school what they wanted from their life, and almost without exception they said they wanted to be rich and famous. I asked why, and they said because they thought it would make them happy. I asked them why they hadnâ€™t said they wanted to be healthy, for example, and they said because they already were. So why aren't you happy now I asked, and then said being happy is hard. If it's hard now, it's going to be hard then as well, I said. Being happy requires wisdom, which comes from self-understanding, and may not have as much to do with money as we think. Of course the lack of money can make us unhappy, but beyond a point, having more and more money is not a formula for automatic happiness. We explore the subject of happiness in a separate module.
