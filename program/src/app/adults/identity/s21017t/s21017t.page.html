          Our identities can meet our deepest emotional needs we may not even be aware we have - to feel secure, to not be lonely, to belong to a group that will protect us, for a sense of importance, for pleasure, for power and so on. Whenever these needs are met in a sustained way, we become attached. I may not feel attacked if you criticize my choice of ice-cream, but may do if you criticize my political party, or religion or country, or my children, depending on the strength of my attachment to them. I am not aware of this process going on in the background. All I feel is the anger bubbling up in me and I blame you for it
