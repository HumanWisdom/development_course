          Is the environmental crisis because we human beings do not have a caring relationship with the natural world? Why is that? Why have we come to the point of destroying our own home? Perhaps it is because all our relationships are formed when our emotional needs are met in some way - by people, places, pets, possessions and our ideas and beliefs. Nature does not meet these emotional needs, so we have no relationship of caring with it. It is a paradox that everything we need to survive comes from nature, but yet we have not developed a deep relationship with it. What can we do to change this?
