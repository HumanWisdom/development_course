          Our mind unconsciously seeks pleasure from all its activities. We are not always aware of this. This could be from physical intimacy, or just being able to express an opinion, or having fun with our friends, or drinking and so on. The drive to seek pleasure is however strong, so combined with our self-interest it may make us act in ways that lack integrity. All pleasure is also feeting, and this can impact relationships by making us feel bored after a while, and blame the other person for the fact that we donâ€™t feel happy any more
