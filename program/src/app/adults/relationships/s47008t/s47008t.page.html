          Scientists at Harvard University followed adults for 80 years to determine what made them happy. They found that the quality of their relationships, more than money or fame, was the most important factor in their long term happiness. They were surprised to find that the people who were most satisfied in their relationships aged 50, were the healthiest aged 80. Close relationships were better predictors of happy lives, more than social class, IQ or genes
