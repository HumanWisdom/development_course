          This is also a question we may not ask ourselves. Let's explore it together. Are we sensitive to what our body needs? Do we look after it, by eating in moderation, exercising regularly and sleeping enough?

If we do not have a healthy relationship with it, then it's never too late to make amends and begin to change now.
