          Welcome to this session where we are going to explore the many emotional needs we have, some of which we are aware of and others which operate in the background.They are common to all human beings, like a need to be loved. Understanding them allows us to understand others better, explore where they come from, and respond with intelligence. We have explored this subject in more depth in a separate module, but here we explore how these emotional needs operate in our relationships
