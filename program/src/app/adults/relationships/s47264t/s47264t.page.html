          If you want to be in a relationship, you have to learn the art of compromise. It often feels hard because our ego feels like it's losing a tug of war with the other person. Once you realise that we automatically become attached to our conditioning and point of view, and the other person is the same, we can ask if it really matters which movie we see, or where we should hang a painting, and so on. Letting go with grace, and without resentment is important. If you both realise this is just the way our mind works and the importance of compromise - it becomes easier to let go.
