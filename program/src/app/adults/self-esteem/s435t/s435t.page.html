            Welcome to this module on self-esteem. It is part of the 5th circle of wisdom - or living with wisdom, and is influenced by every other circle.  We are going to explore the subject of self-esteem, which is how good we feel about ourselves, in other words how much you like yourself. It impacts our self-confidence and can be a major cause of stress and anxiety. We will explore what it is, the many unconscious patterns of thinking that can contribute to it, the impact of low self-esteem on our lives, and explore how we can respond with wisdom, so we can be confident and at peace with ourselves.
