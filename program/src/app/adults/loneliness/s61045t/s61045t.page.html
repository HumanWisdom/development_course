          The fear of being alone shapes our lives in many ways we are not always aware of. I asked some students why they were so anxious about what others thought of them. ‘Otherwise we would be alone’ they said. Have you ever tried being alone I asked, and they said ‘No’. This fear can push us to be part of a group and do things like take drugs or drink too much, that we may not always be comfortable with.
           Or it may push us to join groups we don’t agree with, just so we are not alone.
