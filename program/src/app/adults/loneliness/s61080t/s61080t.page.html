          What does it mean to travel inwards and make peace with our loneliness. How can we do that? The next time you are lonely, sit quietly with that feeling. You will feel like escaping from it and your mind will suggest familiar things to do. Watch that. Keep sitting with it. Do a breathing exercise and get into a rhythm. Let go of all resistance to the feeling. It is as normal as your breath. Pay complete attention to the feeling, and all the thoughts that arise. Notice the ‘I’ that feels lonely. Pay attention to that as well. Let the feeling wash over you, and offer no resistance to it. As you pay attention, the feeling 
          gradually changes to one of peace. You have to travel inwards yourself and find out if this is true.
