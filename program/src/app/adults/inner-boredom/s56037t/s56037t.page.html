          Let me share a story with you. I was speaking to some 10 year olds in a primary school, and we had been exploring the nature of pleasure. I asked them what they felt when a pleasure ended. They said they felt bored, and needed to find another pleasure to take its place. They said they werenâ€™t aware of their boredom, just the thought they needed to do something new. I asked them what was the answer to our inner boredom - and there was a long silence. A girl said quietly, If I stay with it, it goes away. Try it for yourself and see if it's true for you.
