            Perhaps we can begin by noticing that we judge ourselves as good or bad, right or wrong all the time. Its a pattern that repeats itself. Where does it come from?
            We could then pause the judgement process and ask ourselves why we do that and explore where our idea of what is the ideal me comes from? We may think we decided that ourselves, but if we look more carefully, we may discover that those ideas of who we should be come from our unconscious conditioning.

            Every emotion we feel is the same as in all human beings, and that may also help us look at ourselves without judgement.
