          Once I have done the hard work of letting go of my various images and being authentic I can then begin to look at myself and explore the development work I need to do to grow as a human being. I can’t do that if I am pretending to be someone else - to myself and others. The first step is to accept myself as a whole human being with a mix of light and shadow, like everyone else. I may see that I am not a good listener, or not really as loving as I thought and explore how I can change. Or I may realise I don’t really like books as much as I pretended, and explore other passions instead. Others see I am much more relaxed, authentic and open, and it gives them permission, and inspiration to do the same. People begin to like me for who I am, and not the image I was projecting earlier. That feels wonderful. Everyone can take this journey and be free.
