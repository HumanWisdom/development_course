          In this session we are going to explore how we can live with the fact of death, and how that can help us live a rich, and more fulfilled life. The first step in doing this is to overcome our fear of dying, because that stops us accepting the fact that our life is limited. If we knew our life can end anytime, and we lived everyday with that understanding, would it make us live differently? <br>In what way? It may make us do things we have always wanted to do, for example. In my own life it made me leave a good career as a spine surgeon to  start working in education, and establish the HumanWisdom Project, because it is something I always wanted to do, and I knew my time on this planet was limited, not in a morbid kind of way, but as a simple fact.
