          Welcome. In this session we are going to explore why loss feels so painful. We assume it is because of the person or thing or pet we have lost. There are however many hidden patterns of thinking that contribute to our despair, and we are going to explore them in this session. These include our emotional needs, our anxiety about the future, our loss of identity and our loneliness. A deeper understanding of them can help us respond with wisdom
