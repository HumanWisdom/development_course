          Anything that meets our emotional needs becomes part of our identity. If I lose my husband I am no longer Mrs so and so, and that change feels painful. Or if I cannot practise surgery for health reasons that loss of identity as a surgeon makes me wonder who I am now. Or, if I have been a successful businessman, I may struggle to cope if my business fails. We get attached to our various identities because they meet many of our emotional needs, and when we lose them, it leaves a void that is painful. Our identities
           form unconsciously and we are only aware of our attachment to them when we feel the pain of their loss.
