          We all have many emotional needs we are not aware of. They are a normal part of being human,
           and operate in the background, without our awareness. We have explored these more fully in a 
           separate module, but include a need to be loved, not to be lonely, to feel secure, to be occupied,
            for pleasure and stimulation, and so on. These needs are often met by a close relationship.
             Whenever these needs are met we feel happy and get attached to the object that meets those 
             needs- whether itâ€™s a pet, a person, or a job. When we lose the object that meets these needs,
              we experience sorrow and a range of other emotions. The depth of our despair is dependent on 
              the depth of our emotional attachment, or how much our emotional needs were being met
