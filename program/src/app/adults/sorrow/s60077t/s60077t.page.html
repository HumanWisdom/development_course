          It seems so obvious when someone tells you this but when your mind is reeling from the loss and filled with pain, we forget and it's worth reminding ourselves to do that. It may be that we need to take care of ourselves and our needs first - to eat, drink enough water and get a good night's sleep. The circumstances will determine what we need to do next. It could be arranging for the funeral or looking for another job, and so on. This focus 
          also grounds us to the present and stops our mind wandering, and worrying about the future for example.
