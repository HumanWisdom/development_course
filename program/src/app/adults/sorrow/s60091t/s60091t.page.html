          Sometimes, reminding ourselves that life is short, and a gift and we need to make the most of, can give us the energy we need to do the right thing, to give full attention to the grieving process, and then move on. Grief is a part of life, 
          but it's only a part. If we have lost a loved one, it's what they would have wanted anyway
