          What is joy? How is it different from pleasure. I love this definition - Joy is gladness not based on circumstances. You could say joy is a state of being happy, that does not depend on external events. You donâ€™t pursue joy, it comes from within, or spontaneously, unexpectedly, from the small things in life, like the warmth of the sun on a cool day, or a cool breeze on a hot one, from the smile of a child, and sometimes for no reason, other than you are glad to be alive
