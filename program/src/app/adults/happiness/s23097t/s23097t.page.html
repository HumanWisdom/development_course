          What does it mean to live a life with meaning and purpose?
          What is the state of the mind that asks the question? It may be that we compare our life
          with those that have more money, or fame or status and think we are lacking in some way.
          Or, we feel what we are doing is mundane and boring and not stimulating enough. In either case, as seen in this pyramid, which represents the different layers of our thinking, what is really happening is that we want to be occupied and stimulated by the life we live, and if we arenâ€™t, we can feel our life lacks meaning and purpose
