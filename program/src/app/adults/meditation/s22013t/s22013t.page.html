          To understand the role of meditation let's look at this pyramid which represents the different layers of our thinking. Layer 2 is our conscious mind where we may feel stressed, which we think is being caused by external events, as seen in layer 1. In response to this we begin a meditation practice, and as a result our mind calms down and we feel better. We are not aware that most of our stress and anxiety comes from the unconscious patterns of thinking in layer 3, where the processes of comparison, conditioning and fear operate. Unless we explore and understand the deeper layers of our thinking alongside our meditation practice, the patterns of stress will continue to repeat themselves. Meditation is very helpful in making the mind quiet so we can explore the deeper layers of our thinking.
