          We are drawn to meditation for different reasons. We may want to be 
          healthier, more calm, less stressed or anxious, and so on. Whichever type of meditation
          practise we choose, there is always the ‘I’ wanting to meditate, separate from the meditation 
          practise. It is perhaps also important for our meditation practice to include an understanding of the ‘I’ that is meditating, because the ‘I’ is the source of much of the emotional distress that we hope meditation will address’
