            Try this simple exercise. Sit quietly. Start breathing through your nose.
            Breathe in slowly to a count of 4, 1-2-3-4. Breathe out to a count of 4 1-2-3-4.
            Get into a rhythm. Try and notice the moment a thought comes along and distracts you. It is not easy as it happens quickly. Now observe the moment you become aware of your breathing again. You realise you have been distracted. Do not resist this process. It's natural. Continue doing this for 10 minutes.
