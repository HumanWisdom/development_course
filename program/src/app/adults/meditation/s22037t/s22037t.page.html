          In this session we are going to explore what a meditation practice involves and introduce you to a simple practice which follows your breath. Its charm is its simplicity and you can do it anywhere. It needs no guide. We will also explore the hurdles you may encounter and how to get past them. The key is to begin and make time for it everyday, so it becomes as much a part of your life as brushing your teeth
