          Welcome. In this session we are going to explore how we can use our wisdom to live with a sense of peace within. As we have discussed this is the core desire of most human beings. We all want to live without conflict and a sense of being at ease with ourselves. Living at peace with ourselves, allows us to live in peace with others, and the earth. 
          <br>
          This living in peace does not mean we have a passive life, doing nothing. On the contrary, it means we live with passion, doing everything we want to, but with a feeling of peace within. Give your passion to this enquiry. It is possible for each one of us to live with this feeling of peace, and so to contribute to peace in the world
