          Just as a physical pain calls our attention to a problem we need to address like a toothache, for example, our emotional pain invites us to travel inwards to explore and understand the root cause of it in our thinking. If we accept this invitation and learn about ourselves and how our mind works, we can be free of it. If we ignore it, or blame others for it, and do not learn, it grows and keeps repeating itself. For example, if your criticism hurts me, I can travel inwards to learn about my images, the nature of the ‘I’ that feels hurt, and not only be free of pain, but be able to respond with wisdom. So the pain of criticism has taught me something new about myself. In this way, I gradually learn to live in peace.
