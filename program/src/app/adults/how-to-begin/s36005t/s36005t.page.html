            The first thing we need to embark on this inner journey to learn about ourselves is a sense of curiosity, which we once had as children. See how children spend time looking at something, trying to understand it. We need the same curiosity to explore our inner spaces.

            I love this quote from Einstein. We just need to bring the same curiosity to learning about ourselves.

            That then leads to a deeper understanding of the nature of pleasure, which helps me understand so many other things about my life.
