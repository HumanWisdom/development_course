          Being in a leadership role means the challenges never stop coming. How are you going to cope with all the stress these challenges bring? You donâ€™t even know where the next one is going to come from. You know you need to be resilient, but how does one do that?
          Almost 90% of stress is linked to how our mind reacts to a situation, rather than the situation itself. That reaction is mostly automatic and comes from our unconscious conditioning. A deeper understanding of the origins of stress in our thinking allows you to remain calm, zoom out and focus on solutions. You can ask for help and a wise leader knows when to do that, and that it is now a sign of weakness.
