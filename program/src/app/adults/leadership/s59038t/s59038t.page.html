           Welcome to this session where we explore how wisdom can help you develop leadership skills. 
          This wisdom can not only help you be a good leader, but also be a successful human being, 
          on the inside, and in the world. Most of the ideas in this session have been explored elsewhere 
          in the program, but  we bring them together to focus on how they can help us be better leaders.
           You will see that they require you to go inwards and develop a deeper understanding of yourself
            and how your mind works. We are going to go through the list of qualities we expect of leaders 
            we discussed in session 1, 
          and then explore how a deeper self-understanding can help us acquire them for ourselves.
