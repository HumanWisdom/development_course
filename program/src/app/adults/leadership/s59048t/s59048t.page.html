          Your success as a leader depends on your ability to listen to others, make well thought through 
          judgements and be able to communicate your ideas to others. This is no easy thing, and there are 
          many ways we can get it wrong. It is particularly important to check what others have understood 
          once you have said something, and equally important to check your understanding of what others 
          have said, by asking them a question. Active listening is a skill we can all learn. 
          To give someone our complete attention, even if it is for 5 minutes, is the mark of a good leader.
           It is important to look beyond the words being spoken, to understand what people may not be able 
           to say, perhaps out of fear. The more you observe yourself as you communicate,
           the more you can understand others, and can improve your communication skills.
