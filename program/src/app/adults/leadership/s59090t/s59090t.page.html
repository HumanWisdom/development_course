          You need to expect the unexpected, and have planned for it. What if it's not in the rule-book and you donâ€™t have a plan? The first step is to breathe, pause and zoom out. Staying calm is crucial. The team is looking for you to do that. Canvas different opinions. Take them all seriously. They may offer perspectives you may not have considered. Do a quick risk analysis - what are the risks of implementing each of the options, including doing nothing. Is the hardest choice the right one? Have the courage to opt for that one, if it's the right thing to do. Avoid the temptation to cover things up, or run away from the problem, or start blaming people. The solution always lies in studying the problem. Will your proposed solution 
          result in other problems? Focus on doing the right thing, and not on how this will affect you personally.
