          People expect a lot from their leaders? They expect them to be better than they are and
           are disappointed when they fall short. Leaders realize they are under the spotlight and 
           struggle to meet their own expectations of themselves sometimes. The list of qualities a 
           leader is expected to have these days is long - they need to have integrity, be visionary, 
           be fair, be a good communicator, be able to delegate to others, have courage, have 
           self-awareness, be able to constantly learn new things, and  be able to foresee challenges
            that have not yet appeared. They need to hire the right people  and be able to inspire and 
            influence them. How can we expect one person to embody all of this? Nothing in our education teaches us any of these skills. 
          That is why good leaders are difficult to find.
