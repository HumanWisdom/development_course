          You will be called to sort out disagreements between different members of your team, all of whom are strongly attached to their own point of view. You could begin by asking people where their opinions come from? What conditioning influences led to them? And is their hidden self-interest playing a part? If they could put their self-interest aside, what's good for the organisation as a whole? Ask them to swap roles, and argue the other person’s point of view as if it is their own. Explore why 
          they are attached to their points of view, and if they weren’t what would be a good compromise position to take?
