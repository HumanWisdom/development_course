          How can we inspire others to work hard towards the vision we have set out? If you embody all the
           qualities of a good leader, and are seen to be hard working, fair, and honest, you will earn the
            respect of others, and that is the first step. You then have to articulate a vision for where you 
            want to get to in such a way that others want to get to the same place themselves. Everyone is
             looking for work to give them a sense of purpose and you have to articulate that for them. 
             You have to then support people and help them be better versions of themselves, and dream of 
             being even better. You lead by your actions, not always by your words. To follow you, people 
             have to feel that you listen to them and care for them. You can’t fake that. Your passion and 
          positivity go a long way in inspiring others, especially in the face of difficult circumstances
