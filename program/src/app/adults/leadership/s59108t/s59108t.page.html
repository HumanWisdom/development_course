           How can you lead an organisation through change? The first step is to make sure it's the right thing to do. Once that is clear, it's about implementation. Begin by getting your core team on board. You will meet plenty of resistance. People are afraid of change, because it involves losing control, and because their particular self-interest may be challenged. Step out of your management bubble and go on a regular walkabout across the organisation talking to the people on the coal face, often the lowest paid. Ask them what they think and how this change can be made easier for them. Communicate clearly. Explain why the change is needed. Let everyone have their say. Set clear time-lines and follow that through. Anticipate challenges and ask yourself what you havenâ€™t thought about. At all times show empathy,
           and be kind. Leadership is not easy. But you already knew that before you took the job.
