          What stops us delegating effectively to others? Or, what makes us want to do everything ourselves? 
          Good leadership is about effective delegation. How can we do that? We may have a particular way we
           want things done, and think others should do it our way. When we delegate we have to accept people
            will have their own way of doing things, and as long as it achieves the same result, it should be
             broadly okay, unless there are ethical issues involved. Our fear of things not getting done can 
             make us want to micro-manage situations, and that can irritate people. The challenge in delegating authority is 
          that we are not delegating responsibility. We are still responsible for what happens.
