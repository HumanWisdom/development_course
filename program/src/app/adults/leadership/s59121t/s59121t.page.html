          There is so little compassion in most organisations. There is no culture of people genuinely caring for each other, and instead, often one of fear and intimidation. To care for others we have to feel good about ourselves and feel cared for. If we feel the organisation cares, we are willing to go the extra mile. When the Taj Mahal Hotel in Mumbai was attacked by terrorists in 2008, the hotel staff went to extraordinary lengths to protect guests, at the cost of their own safety. Several died, when they could have run for safety themselves. This degree of loyalty is only possible if staff feel looked after by the organisation they serve. It is up to you, as the leader, 
          to nurture this culture of kindness and compassion in the organisation so every person feels happy to work there.
