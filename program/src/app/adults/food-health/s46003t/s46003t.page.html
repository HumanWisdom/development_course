          Welcome to this module exploring our relationship to food. It is part of the 5th circle of wisdom, where we apply our understanding of how our mind works to living with wisdom. In this module we will explore the relationship between our thinking patterns and food, and how a deeper understanding can help us avoid and address problems like obesity and eating disorders, which cause so much suffering. Obesity, which is a body mass index of more than 30, affects 42% of people in the US, and 28% of those in the UK and causes a range of health problems from diabetes to heart disease. There are genetic and medical reasons for obesity, but eating more than we need and exercising less than we need is probably the main cause. Eating disorders affect 9% of people in the US and approximately 6.4% of people in the UK and cover a variety of conditions including anorexia and bulimia. They are serious medical illnesses and if you think you may suffer from one, you need to get professional help.
