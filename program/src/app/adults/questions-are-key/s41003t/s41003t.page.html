            In this module we will explore the importance of questions, how they can take us deeper, and open the door to wisdom

            Letâ€™s start with Newton - in 1666 Isaac Newton saw an apple fall from a tree in his mothers garden, asked why, and discovered gravity.
          </p>
          <p>
            He went on to become one of the greatest scientists the world has ever seen.
          </p>
          <p>
            Similarly, we can observe our own thinking, ask why, and make discoveries that may benefit all of humanity.
          </p>
          <p>
            Questions like - is it possible to live without fear? Or how can we connect with other people who are different to us?
