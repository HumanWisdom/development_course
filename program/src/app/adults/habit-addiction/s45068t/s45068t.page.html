          We have explored in the module on desire and pleasure how the human mind unconsciously and automatically seeks pleasure through most of its activities. A common thought is ‘What can I do out there to make me feel good in here’. We do something that brings pleasure for example alcohol, shopping, or drugs. At first it feels wonderful. The pleasure soon fades though - it always does. When it ends it leaves a void that needs filling, and we want to repeat the pleasure, but this time it needs to be bigger and better to give us the same kick - so we drink a bit more, or spend a bit more or need more drugs. The need for pleasure is strong, and this blinds us to the consequences of our actions.
          <br>Before we know it, we have started on the slide into addiction, and then it’s too late to come out by ourselves. Understanding this process can help us avoid it.
