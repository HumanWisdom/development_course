          Life throws challenges at us regularly. Our emotional pain comes from not accepting what has happened. Is it the delayed flight, or our reaction to the delayed flight that causes our stress? If it is the delay, everyone would be equally stressed. But some are not stressed at all. So our stress, or emotional pain, is a reaction from our thinking. It is not our fault. It's an automatic and unconscious reaction to what has happened. It also means taking ownership of our feelings and not blaming others, though of course others are also responsible for how they behave.
