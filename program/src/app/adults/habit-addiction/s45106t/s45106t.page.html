          We have explored the many ways you can do this in a separate section of the app. It's so important to have a regular practice of doing so because it slows down the reactive mind, and allows space for intelligence to act.
         <br> You can also more easily explore the deeper layers of your thinking. <br>
          This understanding of the deeper layers of your thinking, combined with a quiet mind, awakens your own inner intelligence, and leads to wisdom, which can be life-changing. You have to take the journey yourself and find out. Consider this entire program as a guide.
