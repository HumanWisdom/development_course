          The Human Wisdom Program is designed to help you learn about yourself and how your mind works, and apply this understanding to your life, so you can live with wisdom, joy and a sense of peace. If one is new to all this, how does one begin?
        </h3>
          <h3 class="transcript_txt"> 
          The entire program is inter-connected so you could follow your interest and begin with a subject that interests you - like stress, or relationships, or communication.
          Or, you could follow the full program in sequence, beginning with exercises to nurture a quiet mind and working your way to applying this wisdom to your life.
          Try and complete a module before going to the next one, and reflect on what you are learning by writing in your online journal. The key is to observe your own thinking and apply what you are learning to your life. If you can spare 10 minutes a day to nurture a quiet mind, that will help you to be more sensitive to what is happening inside you. Discussing what you are learning with others on the forum will help your own understanding, as will reading the wisdom stories we have compiled. If you have a question you want to explore, you can talk to a wisdom coach. If you can introduce the program to a friend you can do it together.
          You may do the program for only half an hour a day, but then carry that awareness and understanding with you through the day. Commit yourself to deepening your understanding of yourself, and change will follow naturally. 
        </h3>    
          <h3 class="transcript_txt">    
          All you need to bring to the program is your curiosity, commitment and a mind that is open to learning. The more time and commitment you put in, the more you will get out. The program is just a guide to help you learn about yourself. That is the beginning of a life-long journey. That understanding awakens wisdom, which can be life-changing.
