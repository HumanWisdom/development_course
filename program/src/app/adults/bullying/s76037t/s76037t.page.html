            Controlling behaviour is a form of bullying. A man may feel insecure and that makes him believe his girlfriend is going to go off with someone else. That insecurity may make him try and control the behaviour of his girlfriend and decide whom she sees, and where she spends her time. He may even get jealous if she is out with her girlfriends because that somehow makes him feel all her attention is not reserved solely for him. Because he is not aware of his own deep-seated insecurities, which may come from his childhood - he blames her for how he feels and that control can even turn to violence and domestic abuse.

            This can begin in the playground where you may feel insecure if your best friend goes and spends time in another group
