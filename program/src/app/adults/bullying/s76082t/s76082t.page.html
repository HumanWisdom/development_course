            Bad things happen to all of us. How can we move on from the past, so it does not impact the present in ways that do not serve us?
          </p>

          <p>
            The first step is to keep a diary and write down the many different ways past bullying has shaped your thinking, and your actions - and if that serves you today.
          </p>

          <p>
            Are you more wary of people now, are you quick to react to any perceived criticism, or do you bully others and are not aware you are doing so?
          </p>

          <p>
            Your self-esteem which was damaged by bullying may not have recovered, or you may be overeating to compensate for the distress you still feel.
          </p>

          <p>
            Once you become aware of the many hidden ways your past impacts your present, you can ask if that still serves you, and if it doesnâ€™t, let it go.
