          The process by which opinions are formed and expressed is automatic and unconscious in us all. We can break that pattern by asking if we need to have an opinion at all, and even if we do, do we need to express it? Quite often you may pause here and realise that it's not going to be well received and not say anything. Or, you could say ‘I do not know enough about this person or this subject to have a well-informed opinion’. Now, wouldn't that be refreshing? Or go and research the facts before forming an opinion. We are sometimes too quick to accept opinions as facts, and repeat them without pausing to ask if they are accurate, especially in this age of instant social media.
