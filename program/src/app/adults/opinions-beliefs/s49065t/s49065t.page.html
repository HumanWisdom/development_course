          Our personal beliefs are what we feel we can and cannot do, and our narratives about ourselves. I may think I can never be a writer so never write that book I’d wanted to for years, or may think I can’t run, so never go running. Or, I may believe I am not worthy of being loved, and so do not look for a life partner. 
          <br>These personal beliefs come to us from our conditioning influences and we believe they are true. We never examine or challenge them. They end up shaping and limiting our lives. They become part of the ‘me’ and we are so convinced they are true, that when someone challenges us to start running, for example, we resist that and say ‘Oh, I can’t run. I’ll never be able to do that’.
