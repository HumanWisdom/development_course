          This pyramid which represents the different layers of our thinking helps us understand how our beliefs form. In layer 1 are all the external influences we grow up with - in this case say I grow up in a catholic family. Layer 2 represents my thoughts and feelings, and so I regard myself as catholic and go to church regularly. Because there is a history of conflict with protestants in Belfast where I grew up, I get influenced by that too, and start having negative thoughts about them. In layer 3 are the hidden patterns of thinking that are shaping my beliefs - in this case my conditioning, my emotional needs and my attachment to my beliefs. In layer 4 is the ‘I’ that feels restless, empty and where my fears and insecurities originate. All my beliefs help to cover over these feelings I have so I become attached to them.
