            Conditioning is a fact of life for us human beings and is neither right nor wrong, but just something we need to understand. I was conditioned for example to look after my parents as they grew older, and I did that without thinking, and that was a wonderful thing for me, for them and my children. So conditioning can be very helpful in many ways - helping us know what are the social norms of behaviour for example. There are other ways it can be a challenge and we will explore those in detail as well.
