            Here we apply what we learned in the Art of Enquiry, and if you haven't done that module yet, it may be helpful to do so now.

          <p>
            We begin with the 3 steps to enquiry - to first notice and then, accept that our thoughts come from our own thinking, and then question why we think that way.

            In this example say I meet you and you have very right wing political views. I start arguing with you and the argument gets quite heated. We both try and convince each other we are right and our relationship gets strained. If I pause and ask why I think the way I do and what's behind the argument, it becomes clear that we have both been conditioned differently and are attached to our respective views. Then I can ask in which other way I've been conditioned, and discover so much more. As a result our argument ends. IT all begins by taking ownership of what I am thinking and feeling and asking whats going on in my thinking to make me think this way.  Remember conditioning isnt wrong, but questioning it allows us to respond with intelligence
