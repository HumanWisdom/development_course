            It is not easy to do, but you can only begin to explore your anger if you let go of the idea of right and wrong or whose fault it is, and accept that anger is a reaction from your own thinking, or your conditioned mind, which is a sum of all your past influences. It may help to realise that anger is not unique to you and part of being human. This acceptance also focuses your attention on dealing with this anger, rather than lashing out at others.
