            Anger is an unconscious, automatic reaction from our thinking to events in the world around us. Alternatively we can get angry with ourselves.  In this session we are going to explore the nature of anger, and its effect on others and ourselves. We donâ€™t seem to have any control of the feeling of anger, but how we express it depends on our circumstances. Sometimes it erupts out of us, and at other times we internalise it and it lasts a long time, as the memory of the hurt lingers. We always seem to justify our anger and rarely think we are wrong. We mostly  blame others or a situation for our anger. The nature of anger is the same in all human beings.
