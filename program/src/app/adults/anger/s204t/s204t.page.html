            The first question to ask yourself - Are you or is anyone around you in immediate danger?
          </p>

          <p>
            If the answer is NO, relax, you have time to respond. This question can break the automatic anger reaction, when you realise there is no imminent physical threat, and itâ€™s just a reaction from our thinking process
