            Welcome. In this module we are going to explore how we can use our understanding of the nature of anger, and the art of enquiry, to respond to anger with wisdom. Anger is neither right or wrong, and part of being human, but we can use our inner intelligence to manage it so it can protect us if needed, and make sure it does not harm us or others.
