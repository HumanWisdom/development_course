            We usually express our anger when we can’t control it anymore, or in situations where we have the upper hand or feel its safe to do so - towards our family members, or our employees, or to the waiter in a restaurant. We probably don’t express it to our friends because we may lose the friendship or to our boss at work. When we do express it , it feels like a release of a pent up emotion, and there is a subtle pleasure in that. Since we feel our anger is always justified, there is a subtle pleasure in feeling right about things too
