            Consider another example. My son is still in bed at 12pm and I look at that and get irritated and angry with him. He reacts back and we end up in an argument. I am sure I am right and he is wrong.
          </p>

          <p>
            He justifies his actions, and we fall out.
          </p>

          <p>
            I pause and ask myself, what’s behind my anger. I discover it’s my conditioning which says it’s not okay to sleep in so late, and just a difference between me and him. Can I accept the situation as it is? As soon as I do, my anger melts away.This does not mean we do not have a discussion about his sleeping habits, but it could be a friendly one, and not one laced with anger.
