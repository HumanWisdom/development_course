            Anger feels like a fire in the brain, and as with any fire our urgent need is to escape. Expressing our anger feels like a release. How can you interrupt the anger reaction, which is faster than a bullet coming out of a gun? You could take a deep breath, become grounded in the present, and do one of the breathing exercises you learned in the section on nurturing a quiet mind.
          </p>

          <p>
            You need to practice these exercises regularly, even when there is no problem, so when the anger storm comes, you are ready and can slip into a breathing exercise more easily.
          </p>

          <p>
            You can also walk away.
          </p>

          <p>
            If you are in an argument, and see a trigger beginning to cause an anger reaction. you can just say, “can we talk about this later?”
