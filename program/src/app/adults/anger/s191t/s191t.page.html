            The extent of our anger reaction depends on how disturbed our mind is at that time, and our reaction can seem disproportionate to the event. If I have had a bad day at the office and am driving home and have a minor car accident, I can get out and get really angry. I may not have reacted in that way yesterday when I was happy.
           </p>

           <p>
            Or, if we are in a relationship, and I am irritated with you generally, I can get angry about the smallest thing, like how the soap is always out of the soap dish.
           </p>

           <p>
            Or if I am a member of a gang, and there is violence all around me and my life is hard, the smallest trigger, like someone making prolonged eye contact can elicit a violent response. This can help us understand the behaviour of others who are angry, and help us respond with intelligence.
