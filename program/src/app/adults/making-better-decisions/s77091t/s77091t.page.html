            That is part of life and you need to be prepared for that.

            The key is to learn from them and not live with regret because that stops you living fully in the present. 
          </p>

            Our patterns of behavior can repeat themselves because the hidden drivers in our thinking have not been understood. For example, we can repeatedly buy the same thing like shoes, even though we have more than we need, or we may make the same mistakes in our relationships.
