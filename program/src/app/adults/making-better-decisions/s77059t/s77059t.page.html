            At the core of our thinking is our self-interest. We may not be aware of it, or not want to acknowledge it because we don’t like to think of ourselves as ‘selfish’. But it influences all our decisions if you take the care to notice. It is not wrong - but being aware of it operating in us allows us to make the right choices for ourselves and others.
          </p>

          <p>
            Notice when you meet people - the voice in your head is saying ‘What's in it for me?’ Just notice it without justifying it or being critical.
          </p>

          <p>
            At work, in a meeting, notice it operating in all the opinions people have and the positions they take. Does anyone ever say - My department has more money than we need and I’m happy to give it to you’ - you can see that between countries as well.
          </p>

          <p>
            It is just a fact of being human - being aware of it allows us to make the unconscious - conscious - so we can be in charge and decide what the right thing to do is.
