            The need to be recognised, and famous is ingrained into the human mind and operates in the background, shaping our decisions in ways we may not be aware of. This brings us pleasure and strengthens the sense of ‘Me’ or the ego, which make us feel good.
          </p>

          <p>
            It’s the driver behind our social media activities - trying to get more likes from people we haven’t even met. 
          </p>

          <p>
            Or at work we want to be appreciated, and stand out from our colleagues and are disappointed if we are not recognised, and elated when we are.
          </p>

          <p>
            Or we may push to rise to the top of an organization we are part of - or if we are in politics want to be the leader.
          </p>

          <p>
            If we don’t get what we want we can feel really disappointed, and if we do the pleasure is short lived and we want something more.
          </p>

          <p>
            This is neither right nor wrong - but just something to be aware of and understand and then ask ourselves how this serves us.
