            Sometimes we have an inner voice which is telling us one thing, but because that is contradicting what we have decided to do, we tend to not listen to it. 
          </p>

          <p>
            It is worth giving your inner voice space to be heard and consider what it is saying.
          </p>

          <p>
            If you are a doctor, your sixth sense can often tell you something is not right with a patient even though all the tests are negative. This is true in any field you have experience. 
          </p>

          <p>
            Or in a romantic relationship, your inner voice can tell you that something is not right with a person, and the relationship is unsuitable for you, even though you find that person attractive.
          </p>

          <p>
            Nurturing the sensitivity to be able to hear that inner voice, and then having the courage to consider what it is saying is an important skill to learn
