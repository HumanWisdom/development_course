            Our environment also shapes our thinking and our decisions.
          </p>

          <p>
            If people around us are prejudiced towards a certain minority group, that becomes our thinking as well - and determines how we behave towards them.
          </p>

          <p>
            Or if we are part of a group where everyone is drinking or smoking or taking drugs, or bullying others, that gradually becomes our norm too - and all along we think we are in control of our own actions.
          </p>

          <p>
            Or if the boss and the rest of the group want to go drinking after work we decide to go along because we donâ€™t want to be left out.
          </p>

          <p>
            If everyone around us is chasing money and fame, we start doing that too - and think it is what we want for ourselves
