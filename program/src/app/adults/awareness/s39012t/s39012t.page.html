            Another example of these different layers at work is the difference between our real motive, and what we tell ourselves and others. Say I'm a politician. I convince myself and others that I am in politics to make a difference and serve people. 
          </p>
          
          <p>
            That's all I see. Hidden from awareness though in layer 3 are my many emotional needs - for power, to be important, feel secure, and for pleasure.
          </p>

          <p>
            Deeper still, in layer 4, is my self-interest that operates quietly in the background. None of these are wrong by the way.
          </p>

          <p>
            If we are not aware of whatâ€™s going on in layer 3 and 4, then the patterns there will govern our behaviour, without our awareness or our consent.
          </p>

          <p>
            If we can be aware of it, we can respond with wisdom and intelligence.
