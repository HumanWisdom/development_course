          So many of us are unprepared for failure. It is logical that whenever we set out towards a certain goal, whether it to pass an exam or a driving test, get a job or a promotion, or to win the heart of someone, there is a chance of failure. We may be bright, have had good grades in school and college, and that makes us feel we can never fail, so when failure arrives we get knocked sideways, and can feel like we are drowning. In this session we are going to explore how we can better prepare for failure, how to use it as a learning experience and how we can respond with intelligence.
