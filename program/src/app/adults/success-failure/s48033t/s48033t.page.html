          Hi! In this session we are going to explore some of the problems that chasing success can cause, and why. Chasing success is so built into us these days, from our families and the society we grow up in. This conditioning is powerful and we canâ€™t think of another way to be sometimes. We rarely pause to ask what are the pitfalls of chasing success, and often only discover them years later. We may look back and wish we had thought of them earlier, so could have voided the wasted years. Understanding and reflecting on the problems chasing success can cause, can allow us to make conscious choices for our lives.
