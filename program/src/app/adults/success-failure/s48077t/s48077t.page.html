          The human mind is easily distracted. You may work for 8 hours a day, but be able to focus for only 2-3 of those. If you can give your complete attention to the task at hand, and do one job at a time, you can improve your productivity, be less stressed, and be more creative. Scientists reckon we are most productive if we focus for 52 minutes, and take a 17 minute break after that.
          The most successful people can bring a laser like focus to the task at hand and do one thing at a time. Shutting the phone down for that period may help.
