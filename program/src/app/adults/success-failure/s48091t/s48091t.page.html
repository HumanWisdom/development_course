          How can we prepare ourselves for failure? We rarely ask ourselves this question. Sometimes, just asking the question is enough. Before we start any journey, we could mentally accept we may not get there. Two amazing things happen if we can do that. Firstly, we lose all our fear and anxiety, because we have already made our peace with failure. Secondly, we have a back-up plan - what we will do if we fail. So if we don’t succeed, we don’t feel it's the end of the world.
