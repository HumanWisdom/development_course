          You are only as successful as the people you are working with. Though everyone remembers Neil Armstrong as the man who walked on the moon, there were 400,000 engineers and technicians who worked on the Apollo program. Without their dedication the moon landings would have been impossible. How you deal with people is going to be critical to your success. 
          <br>Do people who work with you want you to succeed? How emotionally intelligent are you? How well do you respond to criticism? Do you help others be the best they can be? How well do you communicate with others? How do you manage conflict? Our modules on criticism, relationships and communication cover this in depth.
