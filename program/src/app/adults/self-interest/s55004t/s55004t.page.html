          Welcome to this module where we are going to explore the subject of self-interest, which is at the core of being human. It is part of the 3rd circle of wisdom where we explore how the mind works. This is common to all human beings and usually operates in the background, beyond our awareness. We have a natural resistance to exploring it because we don’t want to think we are selfish. We hate that term and don’t want to apply it to ourselves - only to others. Exploring our self-interest can help improve our relationships, make us better communicators, awaken compassion, and ensure that our hidden self-interest does not corrupt our intentions. Please keep an open mind as we travel together. Just be curious and lets see what we can discover.
