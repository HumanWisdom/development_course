          Today, a friend was talking about a child with a rare genetic disorder and the many struggles the boy, and the family faced. A response started forming in my mind. It came from my time spent working in a children's hospital and seeing many disabled children there. I noticed the urge to interrupt and speak and share this very important opinion I had. As I did so I realized I was only half listening. Slowly, a realization dawned on me. My friend was not really interested in my opinion. She just wanted to share her story. I realized the kind thing to do was just to listen. The urge to speak fell away. All thoughts of wanting to steer the conversation to what I wanted to talk about fell away. I just stopped, and listened without any resistance. An amazing thing happened - my mind went completely silent, and in that silence there was a deep sense of peace. I continued listening in that way.
