          Welcome to this session where we are going to explore how we can use wisdom to better understand ourselves and others. Besides listening and speaking, this is the third pillar of communication and perhaps the most important. Think of the times when you felt deeply understood and how wonderful that felt. We can offer that gift to others.
          Understanding is an art we can all learn. It can enhance our relationships and reduce conflict in our personal lives, and in the world. What is going on in our thinking that helps us understand what others mean? I invite you to join me as we find out.
