          Suppose you are the boss and you need to provide feedback to an employee about their performance? What can you do? People vary in their ability to receive criticism - some accept it with grace as a learning experience and are grateful, others get angry and defensive. You have to be prepared for both. Perhaps begin by speaking of all the good things the person has done, and then talks of areas they could improve. Give them a chance to feed back. Set clear goals for next steps and provide the support people need to improve. How you say things is perhaps more important than what you say. Be as specific as you can be, and donâ€™t make it personal. There is never a right way. Stay calm, even if the other person gets upset.
