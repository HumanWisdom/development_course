          Many relationships, between parents and children, and between partners, friends and work colleagues remain superficial, and so do not meet our deep human need for connection. As a result we remain unfulfilled and can feel lonely. To feel close to others, we need to deepen the connection we have with them. How can we do that? This requires us to share what is actually going on in our hearts and mind and listen deeply to others,  and the more we can do that, the closer we can feel to people. Sharing our deepest thoughts and feelings with others takes courage and can make us feel vulnerable and afraid we could get hurt. The fear of being hurt is what keeps relationships superficial, and stops us from experiencing their full potential.
