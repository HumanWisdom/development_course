          Our mind constantly compares what it is hearing with what it knows, and this creates a reaction. We have explored this in the module on comparison. For example, if you are telling me about your great round of golf and how you won the tournament, I may feel jealous, and want to tell you a story about my football game, to try and impress you or show you that I am better in some way. Or, if you have had more marks than me in the same exam, and are telling me how happy you are, I may stop listening, not be happy for you and instead start feeling angry with you for making me feel bad. I may say something rude or walk off, and you are left wondering what happened.
