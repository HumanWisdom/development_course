          Have you noticed a tendency in yourself to be instinctively critical of others you meet, to find something that is not quite right about them, and to talk about them afterwards? How often do you do that? It is part of the automatic response from our thinking, where we are critical of any difference we find, because it is a subtle way of strengthening our own ego. It can become a habit, especially at home and with children and family members. We explore this in detail in the module on criticism. We can begin by just becoming aware of the process in our thinking and seeing what impact that has on others.
