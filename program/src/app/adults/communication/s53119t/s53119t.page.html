          Just as it's important to pause before speaking to allow intelligence to step in and do the right thing, it is perhaps even more important to not let fear stop you from speaking out if there is an injustice being done. Evil thrives when good men are silent. Speaking out has its consequences and needs to be done with intelligence. History has shown that all great social change, like the ending of slavery, or colonialism, needed men and women to stand up and speak the truth and it takes courage to do that. All around the world journalists do that every day.
