          When we are caught up in fear’s storm, it takes over our thinking and we see demons everywhere,
           and we are convinced they are real. Watch our 10 minute video in the Get support now section for
            14 ways you can manage your fear right now. Realise that most fears are imaginary, and our mind
             magnifies them. Is there an equal chance that the outcome could be just fine? If you feel you 
             can accept whatever happens in the future, your fear can end immediately. The other way is to be
              still and meet fear without language, and without thinking as we have explored in the art of enquiry.
               All fear is based on thinking, and if you can meet it without thinking, you cut off its oxygen
                supply and it can end. The more you explore the nature of fear, and question it, the easier it 
                becomes to deal with it. It’s simple, but not easy.
