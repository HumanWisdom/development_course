          We spend so much of our life at work. Work can be a source of great satisfaction, but also a 
          source of great unhappiness. We have to build healthy relationships with people we have not 
          met before, and who are probably very different to us. We also have to cope with unreasonable 
          bosses, hierarchies, performance reviews, office politics, people pushing each other to get 
          ahead, backbiting and bullying. Statistics vary but some studies suggest that 53% of Americans
           are unhappy at work, as are 24% of Britons. A global gallup poll suggested that number could
            be as high as 85%. Whatever the actual number, that is far too many. In this module we are
             going to explore if we can use wisdom to make the most of the time we spend at work.
