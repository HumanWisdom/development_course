          How does the unconscious process of comparison affect us at work?
          We compare ourselves with what others are earning, the holidays they are going on, 
          how they are doing in the organisation, and so on. Each time we do that, we may feel
           a burst of envy which can be hurtful. This hurt can make us angry at others, erode our 
           relationships, and lower our own self-esteem. If we think others are better than us, we 
           may lose interest in the work we are doing because we may think we will never be good enough. 
           This constant comparison with others can erode the quality of the relationships we have with 
           others, and which we need to get our job done well. Its behind much of the dysfunction in 
           organisations.
