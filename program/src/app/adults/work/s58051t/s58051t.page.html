          Regular feedback is part of most jobs, and depending on where you are in the pyramid, 
          it can seem very one way and create anxiety. Many teachers leave the profession because they
           cannot cope with the constant assessment. We have explored this in more detail in the module 
           on criticism, but if we adopt a more positive attitude to feedback, we can learn something new,
            and get better at what we are doing. Perhaps we could avoid taking it personally. 
            It is so much better to know what people think of our work, so we can have a chance
           to address whatever problem it is we cannot see. We all have blind spots in our thinking and
            behaviour and it is so helpful for someone to point it out, so we can deal with that.
             Lastly, all employers love people with a positive attitude to feedback, since it's not
              common.
