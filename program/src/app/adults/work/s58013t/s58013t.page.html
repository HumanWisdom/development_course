          Most workplaces are organised as hierarchies, with the leader at the top, and several layers of
           managers and workers beneath. This is necessary in large organisations. What challenges does this
            pose, and how can we respond ? Suppose you don’t like your manager, or your colleagues - that can
             be a challenge. We could begin by asking ourselves, why don't we like them? What is going on in
              our thinking that makes us react to them in that way? Could we change how we see them, and would
               that change how we feel about them? If we can, that is the simplest solution, because it does
                not involve anyone else. If people don’t like us, instead of getting defensive and reactive, we could ask why that is, and if there is a blind spot in our attitude or behaviour we need to address. If we need to
           have a difficult conversation to resolve matters, it is much better than letting things fester
