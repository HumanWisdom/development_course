            In this module we are going to explore the many internal obstacles we can encounter on this journey of learning about ourselves and the discovery of wisdom, which can be life-changing. We are used to external challenges and obstacles in our life, but unfamiliar with internal ones. They are subtle and operate from behind the curtain of our awareness. Shining a light onto them helps us avoid them, so we can experience the life-changing benefits of this wisdom for ourselves.
