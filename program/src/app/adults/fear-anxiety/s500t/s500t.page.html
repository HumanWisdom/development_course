            The anxious mind finds no shortage of things to worry about, and is convinced the cause of the worry is ‘out there’ in layer 1, as seen in this pyramid. Hidden from our awareness, the real cause of the worry lies in layer 3, and is linked to an automated process of thinking, and not your fault, as we will explore. At this point if you can just accept this simple idea, it sets the stage for the next step in our exploration. This also explains why we have no control over our worries, and why people react differently to the same situation.
