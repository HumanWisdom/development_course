            Do parents sometimes pass on their fears to their children? Or do we burden them with our own unfulfilled dreams that we wish to live through them? Do we realise that this can result in stress and anxiety as they get older? This happens unconsciously, and if we woke up to this, perhaps we could respond with intelligence.
