            Our thinking process usually presents us with only one point of view, and that is the one that generates our fear. We are usually certain there is only one way to see the situation. This is how our mind works. It is therefore helpful to ask if there is another way to see this situation. There almost always is, and if we can do that consciously, our fears can end. For example, we may be worried about getting criticized, but another way to see the same situation could be that we could learn something new about ourselves if that happened.
