            Many of our fears never come to pass. In one study 85% of the things people worried about never happened, and of the ones that did people said they coped quite well. When we are afraid of something happening in the future, our mind is almost certain it is definitely going to happen. That's just the way our mind works. That is why its good to ask this question and also ask if its equally likely not to happen, and if there is anything now you can do to prevent it from happening - you may start looking for other jobs, if you are worried about losing your job, for example.
