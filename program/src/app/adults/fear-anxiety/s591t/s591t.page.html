            We have learned that fear is a response from our thinking, and sometimes it is a creation of our imagination, and not real. We may be afraid of aliens, or of spiders, or of the dark. We humans have a long list of strange things we are afraid of - search for the list yourself and you will find many you just canâ€™t relate to. Now ask yourself if your own fear is real, or a product of your thinking. What is the evidence for it?
