            Our thinking process often magnifies the fears we do have, and imagines the worst possible outcome. If we are afraid of exams, our fear is we are going to fail, rather than not just do as well. Or if someone does not call as we expected, we imagine they donâ€™t like us anymore, rather than just busy, and so on. This is not unique to you - the human mind has evolved in this way, from a time when physical threats were common. This understanding helps us to question our initial assumptions.
