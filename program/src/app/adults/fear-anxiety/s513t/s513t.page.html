           Fear of being hurt can make us close our hearts to love, and not let any one in. As a result we live, as the poet maya Angelou said, ‘Coiled in shells of our own loneliness’. Our relationships remain superficial and we can feel lonely in them, because we are afraid of being hurt and open our hearts to others. It is the depth and quality of our relationships that contribute to our long term happiness, and our fear of being hurt by others can make us miss out. To go deeper we need to be vulnerable and accept that risk of being hurt sometimes, and not be afraid of it. Our lives can be so much richer if we can do this
