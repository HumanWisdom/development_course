                    Welcome to your personal dashboard on relationships.The art of successful relationships is perhaps the most important life skill we can learn - but one which is not taught anywhere. 
                    From the day we are born we are in a relationship with someone - our parents, friends, partners, brothers and sisters, our children, our work colleagues and so on. We also have a relationship with our possessions, our ideas and beliefs and with the earth. You may be looking for love and think it's all about finding the perfect person to be with - but here you will learn how to be the best version of yourself so others who are looking for love can find you at your best.  Our happiness depends on how successful our relationships are. You are going to learn how to deal with conflict when it arises, but then go deeper to understand why the conflict occurs in the first place. You will also explore what love is, and what it is not and how you can be more loving. Understanding yourself helps you to understand others and this can help you have fulfilling relationships with depth and meaning. Learning never ends so come back here often  - you will learn something new each time.
