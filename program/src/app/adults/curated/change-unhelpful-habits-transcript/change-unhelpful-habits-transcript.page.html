                    Welcome to your personalised dashboard. Our mind forms habits as a way of making our lives efficient. Like brushing our teeth, or driving. Sometimes habits develop that are not helpful and that are difficult to change - like eating too much, or excessive use of the phone, or shopping. Occasionally we develop an addiction which is more serious - to alcohol, or drugs, or gambling. By understanding the many hidden patterns of thinking that are behind our habits and addictions, we can avoid them and more easily overcome them. This understanding may also help us if we have an addiction. We sometimes turn to alcohol or drugs as a way of dealing with our emotional pain so understanding how to deal with that pain is important if we are to avoid addiction. Come back and review this content when you can - you will learn something new and it could be life-changing for you, or somebody else.
