            Insight is not something the mind can acquire through effort, like running a marathon for example.
          </p>
          <p>
            Instead all we have to do is set out on this journey of learning about ourselves with curiosity and passion and these insights will surprise you on a regular basis.
          </p>

            It’s like taking a road trip, and as you turn a corner you may be presented with the most wonderful sight that takes your breath away, it’s so beautiful.
          </p>
          <p>
            Insight is similar, but it also brings transformation. You are changed by it, without realising how that happened. Another example for me was when I realised that I was a poor listener. That awareness itself made me a more attentive listener.
