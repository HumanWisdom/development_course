            A few days ago I woke in the middle of the night. I could not go back to sleep. I kept thinking about a worry that I had during the day and whatever I did I could not stop myself thinking about it. 
          </p>
          <p>
            So I just stopped and just noticed what was going on. I just stayed with the worry, meeting it without language, not thinking about it, or trying to solve it. Something amazing happened. My mind quietened down, and the worry went away. My insight was that if you meet a thought or feeling completely, without language, it transforms. Try it for yourself and see if its true.
