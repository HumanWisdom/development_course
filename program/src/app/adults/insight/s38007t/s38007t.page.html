            In the second stage, you have that insight into what is happening in your thinking, in the moment you are in. For example, as I am talking to someone about politics and an argument begins, I see in real time what is happening deep down in my thinking, and in the other person. That in-the-moment perspective shifts something, and I stop arguing, because I see what is going on.
          </p>
          <p>
            Here, understanding would come to me, like a flash, while I was talking to the other person, and I would see the futility of continuing the argument

          <p>
            I was never going to change the other person's mind, so there was no point repeating myself for the fifth time.
          </p>
          <p>
