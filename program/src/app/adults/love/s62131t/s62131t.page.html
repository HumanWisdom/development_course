          If we are to love others we need to begin by paying attention and be sensitive to what they are thinking and feeling. Our mind is constantly distracted and buzzing with thoughts. We have approximately. 2000 thoughts in an hour. We cannot pay attention with such a noisy mind. What can we do to quieten it down? We have explored this in the section on nurturing a quiet mind. 
          <br>
          You could begin in nature. Just go up to a tree and observe every detail without a single thought coming in the way. As you pay attention your mind quietens down. Or, you could develop a meditation practice, or learn some breathing exercises. A quiet mind is also less reactive, and can respond to others with a calm intelligence, thus avoiding argument and conflict.
