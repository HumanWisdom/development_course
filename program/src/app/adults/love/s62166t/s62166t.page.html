          Sometimes we may have made a mistake in life - we have hurt someone else, or we may have behaved in a way that we are proud of. Mistakes happen. It is part of being human. If you have done the rest of this program you will realise how so much of our behaviour is controlled by our many unconscious patterns of thinking. The key to learn from our mistakes, apologise, make amends if we can, and move on. Our time on this planet is limited. We have to celebrate and  honour the gift of life we have been given by making the most of it. Living with regret does not allow us to do that.
