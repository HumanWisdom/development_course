          Unexpected acts of kindness make people feel loved and create a positive spiral of goodness.
          <br> We have to do this consciously, especially after the initial flush of a romantic relationship ebbs away, because our mind doesn’t think of this naturally. It could be something simple like calling people you haven’t spoken to, or saying a kind word, or cooking something, or leaving a note of appreciation. It does not have to be a grand gesture. Once you start thinking in this way, it can become a habit, and enhance your life in the most unexpected ways. Love is more about what you do, not just what you say or feel.
